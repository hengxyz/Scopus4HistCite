AB  - User verification systems that use a single biometric indicator often have to contend with noisy sensor data, restricted degrees of freedom, non-universality of the biometric trait and unacceptable error rates. Attempting to improve the performance of individual matchers in such situations may not prove to be effective because of these inherent problems. Multibiometric systems seek to alleviate some of these drawbacks by providing multiple evidences of the same identity. These systems help achieve an increase in performance that may not be possible using a single biometric indicator. Further, multibiometric systems provide anti-spoofing measures by making it difficult for an intruder to spoof multiple biometric traits simultaneously. However, an effective fusion scheme is necessary to combine the information presented by multiple domain experts. This paper addresses the problem of information fusion in biometric verification systems by combining information at the matching score level. Experimental results on combining three biometric modalities (face, fingerprint and hand geometry) are presented. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - It is a common spoof to use a photograph to fool face recognition algorithm. In light of differences in optical flow fields generated by movements of two-dimensional planes and three-dimensional objects, we proposed a new liveness detection method for face recognition. Under the assumption that the test region is a two-dimensional plane, we can obtain a reference field from the actual optical flow field data. Then the degree of differences between the two fields can be used to distinguish between a three-dimensional face and a two-dimensional photograph. Empirical study shows that the proposed approach is both feasible and effective. ©2009 IEEE.

AB  - The vulnerability of biometric devices to spoof attacks and various anti-spoofing measures are discussed. Spoof attacks involve the use of an artificial biometric sample to gain unauthorized control. Various anti-spoofing measures have been developed to counteract this problem of spoofing. These anti-spoofing techniques include addition of supervision, password, smart cards, enrolment of several biometric samples, multi-modal biometrics, and liveness testing.

AB  - Research on non-intrusive software-based face spoofing detection schemes has been mainly focused on the analysis of the luminance information of the face images, hence discarding the chroma component, which can be very useful for discriminating fake faces from genuine ones. This paper introduces a novel and appealing approach for detecting face spoofing using a colour texture analysis. We exploit the joint colour-texture information from the luminance and the chrominance channels by extracting complementary low-level feature descriptions from different colour spaces. More specifically, the feature histograms are computed over each image band separately. Extensive experiments on the three most challenging benchmark data sets, namely, the CASIA face anti-spoofing database, the replay-attack database, and the MSU mobile face spoof database, showed excellent results compared with the state of the art. More importantly, unlike most of the methods proposed in the literature, our proposed approach is able to achieve stable performance across all the three benchmark data sets. The promising results of our cross-database evaluation suggest that the facial colour texture representation is more stable in unknown conditions compared with its gray-scale counterparts. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - With the wide deployment of the face recognition systems in applications from deduplication to mobile device unlocking, security against the face spoofing attacks requires increased attention; such attacks can be easily launched via printed photos, video replays, and 3D masks of a face. We address the problem of face spoof detection against the print (photo) and replay (photo or video) attacks based on the analysis of image distortion (e.g., surface reflection, moiré pattern, color distortion, and shape deformation) in spoof face images (or video frames). The application domain of interest is smartphone unlock, given that the growing number of smartphones have the face unlock and mobile payment capabilities. We build an unconstrained smartphone spoof attack database (MSU USSA) containing more than 1000 subjects. Both the print and replay attacks are captured using the front and rear cameras of a Nexus 5 smartphone. We analyze the image distortion of the print and replay attacks using different: 1) intensity channels (R, G, B, and grayscale); 2) image regions (entire image, detected face, and facial component between nose and chin); and 3) feature descriptors. We develop an efficient face spoof detection system on an Android smartphone. Experimental results on the public-domain Idiap Replay-Attack, CASIA FASD, and MSU-MFSD databases, and the MSU USSA database show that the proposed approach is effective in face spoof detection for both the cross-database and intra-database testing scenarios. User studies of our Android face spoof detection system involving 20 participants show that the proposed approach works very well in real application scenarios. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Fingerprint recognition systems are vulnerable to artificial spoof fingerprint attacks, like molds made of silicone, gelatin or Play-Doh. "Liveness detection", which is to detect vitality information from the biometric signature itself, has been proposed to defeat these kinds of spoof attacks. The goal for the LivDet 2009 competition is to compare different methodologies for software-based fingerprint liveness detection with a common experimental protocol and large dataset of spoof and live images. This competition is open to all academic and industrial institutions which have a solution for software-based fingerprint vitality detection problem. Four submissions resulted in successful completion: Dermalog, ATVS, and two anonymous participants (one industrial and one academic). Each participant submitted an algorithm as a Win32 console application. The performance was evaluated for three datasets, from three different optical scanners, each with over 1500 images of "fake" and over 1500 images of "live" fingerprints. The best results were from the algorithm submitted by Dermalog with a performance of 2.7% FRR and 2.8% FAR for the Identix (L-1) dataset. The competition goal is to become a reference event for academic and industrial research in software-based fingerprint liveness detection and to raise the visibility of this important research area in order to decrease risk of fingerprint systems to spoof attacks. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The vulnerability of face recognition systems to presentation attacks (also known as direct attacks or spoof attacks) has received a great deal of interest from the biometric community. The rapid evolution of face recognition systems into real-time applications has raised new concerns about their ability to resist presentation attacks, particularly in unattended application scenarios such as automated border control. The goal of a presentation attack is to subvert the face recognition system by presenting a facial biometric artifact. Popular face biometric artifacts include a printed photo, the electronic display of a facial photo, replaying video using an electronic display, and 3D face masks. These have demonstrated a high security risk for state-of-the-art face recognition systems. However, several presentation attack detection (PAD) algorithms (also known as countermeasures or antispoofing methods) have been proposed that can automatically detect and mitigate such targeted attacks. The goal of this survey is to present a systematic overview of the existing work on face presentation attack detection that has been carried out. This paper describes the various aspects of face presentation attacks, including different types of face artifacts, state-of-the-art PAD algorithms and an overview of the respective research labs working in this domain, vulnerability assessments and performance evaluation metrics, the outcomes of competitions, the availability of public databases for benchmarking new PAD algorithms in a reproducible manner, and finally a summary of the relevant international standardization in this field. Furthermore, we discuss the open challenges and future work that need to be addressed in this evolving field of biometrics. 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The face image is the most accessible biometric modality which is used for highly accurate face recognition systems, while it is vulnerable to many different types of presentation attacks. Face anti-spoofing is a very critical step before feeding the face image to biometric systems. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stream CNN-based approach for face anti-spoofing, by extracting the local features and holistic depth maps from the face images. The local features facilitate CNN to discriminate the spoof patches independent of the spatial face areas. On the other hand, holistic depth map examine whether the input image has a face-like depth. Extensive experiments are conducted on the challenging databases (CASIA-FASD, MSU-USSA, and Replay Attack), with comparison to the state of the art. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Face anti-spoofing is crucial to prevent face recognition systems from a security breach. Previous deep learning approaches formulate face anti-spoofing as a binary classification problem. Many of them struggle to grasp adequate spoofing cues and generalize poorly. In this paper, we argue the importance of auxiliary supervision to guide the learning toward discriminative and generalizable cues. A CNN-RNN model is learned to estimate the face depth with pixel-wise supervision, and to estimate rPPG signals with sequence-wise supervision. The estimated depth and rPPG are fused to distinguish live vs. spoof faces. Further, we introduce a new face anti-spoofing database that covers a large range of illumination, subject, and pose variations. Experiments show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art results on both intra- and cross-database testing. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - The deployment of fingerprint sensors is increasingly becoming common and has now gained high user acceptance. However, fingerprint sensors are susceptible to spoofing using artificial materials or in worst case to the dismembered fingers. Fake/gummy fingerprints have shown to fool most commercial fingerprint systems. This paper proposes a new method of anti-spoofing using reliable liveness detection. The proposed method of liveness detection is based on the principle of pulse oximetry and involves the source of light originating from a probe at two wavelengths. The light is partly absorbed by haemoglobin, by amounts which differ depending on whether it is saturated with oxygen or deoxygenated haemoglobin. We then perform the computations for the absorption at two wavelengths to estimate the proportion of haemoglobin which is oxygenated. The computed percentage of oxygen in the blood, along with the heart pulse rate, determines the liveness of the enrolled biometric. Our experimental results demonstrate that the developed prototype can successfully thwart the spoof attacks (including those based on dismembered fingers). © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - Personal identity verification based on biometrics has received increasing attention since it allows reliable authentication through intrinsic characteristics, such as face, voice, iris, fingerprint, and gait. Particularly, face recognition techniques have been used in a number of applications, such as security surveillance, access control, crime solving, law enforcement, among others. To strengthen the results of verification, biometric systems must be robust against spoofing attempts with photographs or videos, which are two common ways of bypassing a face recognition system. In this paper, we describe an anti-spoofing solution based on a set of low-level feature descriptors capable of distinguishing between live and spoof images and videos. The proposed method explores both spatial and temporal information to learn distinctive characteristics between the two classes. Experiments conducted to validate our solution with datasets containing images and videos show results comparable to state-of-the-art approaches. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - The vulnerabilities of face biometric authentication systems to spoofing attacks have received a significant attention during the recent years. Some of the proposed countermeasures have achieved impressive results when evaluated on intratests, i.e., the system is trained and tested on the same database. Unfortunately, most of these techniques fail to generalize well to unseen attacks, e.g., when the system is trained on one database and then evaluated on another database. This is a major concern in biometric antispoofing research that is mostly overlooked. In this letter, we propose a novel solution based on describing the facial appearance by applying Fisher vector encoding on speeded-up robust features extracted from different color spaces. The evaluation of our countermeasure on three challenging benchmark face-spoofing databases, namely the CASIA face antispoofing database, the replay-attack database, and MSU mobile face spoof database, showed excellent and stable performance across all the three datasets. Most importantly, in interdatabase tests, our proposed approach outperforms the state of the art and yields very promising generalization capabilities, even when only limited training data are used. © 1994-2012 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, a new face anti-spoofing approach, which is based on analysis of contrast and texture characteristics of captured and recaptured images, is proposed to detect photograph spoofing. Since photo image is a recaptured image, it may show quite different contrast and texture characteristics when compared to a real face image. In a spoofing attempt, image rotation is quite possible. Therefore, in this paper, a rotation invariant local binary pattern variance (LBPV) based method is selected to be used. The approach is tested on the publicly available NUAA photo-impostor database, which is constructed under illumination and place change. The results show that the approach is competitive with other existing methods tested on the same database. It is especially useful for conditions when photos are held by hand to spoof the system. Since an LBPV based method is used, it is robust to illumination changes. It is non-intrusive and simple. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - Face biometric systems are vulnerable to spoofing attacks. Such attacks can be performed in many ways, including presenting a falsified image, video or 3D mask of a valid user. A widely used approach for differentiating genuine faces from fake ones has been to capture their inherent differences in (2D or 3D) texture using local descriptors. One limitation of these methods is that they may fail if an unseen attack type, e.g. a highly realistic 3D mask which resembles real skin texture, is used in spoofing. Here we propose a robust anti-spoofing method by detecting pulse from face videos. Based on the fact that a pulse signal exists in a real living face but not in any mask or print material, the method could be a generalized solution for face liveness detection. The proposed method is evaluated first on a 3D mask spoofing database 3DMAD to demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting 3D mask attacks. More importantly, our cross-database experiment with high quality REAL-F masks shows that the pulse based method is able to detect even the previously unseen mask type whereas texture based methods fail to generalize beyond the development data. Finally, we propose a robust cascade system combining two complementary attack-specific spoof detectors, i.e. utilize pulse detection against print attacks and color texture analysis against video attacks. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - As Face Recognition(FR) technology becomes more mature and commercially available in the market, many different anti-spoofing techniques have been recently developed to enhance the security, reliability, and effectiveness of FR systems. As a part of anti-spoofing techniques, face liveness detection plays an important role to make FR systems be more secured from various attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel method for face liveness detection by using focus, which is one of camera functions. In order to identify fake faces (e.g. 2D pictures), our approach utilizes the variation of pixel values by focusing between two images sequentially taken in different focuses. The experimental result shows that our focus-based approach is a new method that can significantly increase the level of difficulty of spoof attacks, which is a way to improve the security of FR systems. The performance is evaluated and the proposed method achieves 100% fake detection in a given DoF(Depth of Field). © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Anti-spoofing is attracting growing interest in biometrics, considering the variety of fake materials and new means to attack biometric recognition systems. New unseen materials continuously challenge state-of-the-art spoofing detectors, suggesting for additional systematic approaches to target anti-spoofing. By incorporating liveness scores into the biometric fusion process, recognition accuracy can be enhanced, but traditional sum-rule based fusion algorithms are known to be highly sensitive to single spoofed instances. This paper investigates 1-median filtering as a spoofing-resistant generalised alternative to the sum-rule targeting the problem of partial multibiometric spoofing where m out of n biometric sources to be combined are attacked. Augmenting previous work, this paper investigates the dynamic detection and rejection of liveness-recognition pair outliers for spoofed samples in true multi-modal configuration with its inherent challenge of normalisation. As a further contribution, bootstrap aggregating (bagging) classifiers for fingerprint spoof-detection algorithm is presented. Experiments on the latest face video databases (Idiap Replay-Attack Database and CASIA Face Anti-Spoofing Database) and fingerprint spoofing database (Fingerprint Liveness Detection Competition 2013) illustrate the efficiency of proposed techniques. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - The concern of the safety of fingerprint authentication system is rising with its widely using for it is easy to be attacked by spoof (fake) fingerprints. Fake fingerprints are usually made of Ploy-Doh, silicon or other artifacts. So most current approaches rely on fingerprint liveness detection as main anti-spoofing mechanisms. Recently, researchers propose to use local feature descriptor for fingerprint liveness detection, but the results are still not satisfying the real world application requirement. Inspired by the newly trend of application of Deep Convolution Neural Network (DCNN) in computer vision field and its outstanding performance in face detection and image classification, we propose a novel fingerprint liveness detection method based on DCNN and voting strategy, which performs better than handcraft feature and optimize the process of feature extraction and classifier training simultaneously. The experimental results on the datasets of LivDet2011 and LivDet2013 show that the proposed algorithm has great improvement compare to the former state-of-the-art algorithm, and keep highly real-time performance at the same time. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - The deployment of fingerprint sensors is increasingly becoming common and has now gained high user acceptance. However, fingerprint sensors are susceptible to spoofing using artificial materials or in worst case to the dismembered fingers. Fake/gummy fingerprints have shown to fool most commercial fingerprint systems. This paper proposes a new method of anti-spoofing using reliable liveness detection. The proposed method of liveness detection is based on pulse oximetry and involves the known source of light originating from a probe at two wavelengths. The light is partly absorbed by haemoglobin, by amounts which differ depending on whether it is saturated with oxygen or deoxygenated haemoglobin. We then perform the computations for the absorption at two wavelengths to estimate the proportion of haemoglobin which is oxygenated. The computed percentage of oxygen in the saturated blood, along with the heart pulse rate, determines the liveness of enrolled biometric. Our experimental results demonstrate that the developed prototype can successfully thwart the spoof attacks (including those based on dismembered fingers). ©2007 IEEE.

AB  - Face biometrics have attracted significant attention as a technology for secure access to mobile devices. This is because almost all smartphones have RGB cameras suitable for capturing faces, and the required user interaction is acceptable given the popularity of ‘selfies’. Most of the traditional methods for face biometrics may not be amenable to native execution on mobile hardware due to their limited memory and computing power. Consequently, a number of algorithms specifically designed or adapted to the mobile environment have been proposed for face biometrics. However, the state-of-the- art related to face biometrics in a mobile environment is not well known. This paper thoroughly and critically surveys face biometrics in terms of face detection and normalization, recognition, and anti-spoofing methods proposed for mobile devices. The overall aim is to improve understanding and discuss the advantages and limitations of the existing methods. Further, challenges and future research directions are identified for further research and development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Many hybrid and multimodal biometric recognition techniques have been presented to provide secure and authentic systems, incorporating both soft and hard biometric schemes. This article proposes a new hybrid technique which ensures the authenticity of the user to the system, as well as monitors whether the user has passed the biometric system as a normal or spoofed one. The proposed scheme is two-fold: Tier I integrates fingerprint, palm vein print and face recognition to match with the corresponding databases, and Tier II uses fingerprint, palm vein print and face anti-spoofing convolutional neural networks (CNN) based models to detect spoofing. In first stage, the hash of a fingerprint is compared with the fingerprint database. After a successful match of the fingerprint, it is tested on a CNN-based model of the fingerprint to verify whether it is a spoof or real. A similar process is repeated for the palm and face, and based on collective evidence, the system permits the user to login the system. Experimental results over five benchmark datasets verified the effectiveness of the proposed system in providing efficient and robust verification, overcoming the limitations in normal authentication and spoofing practices. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper we show the potential of two new features as powerful anti-spoofing measures for face-voice person authentication systems. The features based on latent semantic analysis (LSA) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA), enhance the performance of the authentication system in terms of better anti-imposture abilities and guard against video replay attacks, which is a challenging type of spoof attack. Experiments conducted on 2 speaking-face databases, VidTIMIT and UCBN, show around 42% improvement in error rate with CCA features and 61% improvement with LSA features over feature-level fusion of face-voice feature vectors.

AB  - Among others, spoofing with photos is one of the most common manner to intrude a face recognition system. In this paper, we presents a novel method to deal with this problem, based on the observation that the difference between a photo and a real face usually leads to different distribution behavior in the frequency domain. In particular, we propose to first use a DoG (Difference of Gaussian) filter on the given image to preserve rich information for the subsequent stages while suppressing less-discriminative energy as much as possible. A two-dimensional discrete Fourier transformation is then applied on the filtered image, which produces an input to a sparse logistic regression model to give the final determinant. Furthermore, we adopt an early stoping strategy to prevent the logistic model from overfiting when our training set has class imbalance problem. We also investigate the influence of degree of sparsity on the performance of the system. Extensive experiments on a large scale testing set verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. ©2009 IEEE.

AB  - The proposed system aims to boost the performance of a face anti-spoofing system by fusing pulse based features with other spatial and temporal information that markedly define liveness. Most face recognition systems do not have an effective spoof detection module and hence are vulnerable to spoofing attacks. We address the above problem by developing a spatio-temporal mapping of face and then using a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn discriminative features for liveness detection. CNNs can act directly on the raw inputs, thus automating the process of feature construction. Instead of only relying on the deep CNN to learn features by skimming through all the frames of a sequence, a compact representation of face that captures only the selective features is given as an input. Features are extracted from both spatial and temporal dimensions through spectral analysis, thereby capturing the motion and physiological information encoded in multiple adjacent frames. The developed model generates multiple channels of information from the input frames, and the final feature representation is obtained by combining information from all channels. Our model differs from other models in this aspect. Our system is evaluated on two challenging databases, CASIA [27] and Replay-Attack [7], and the achieved results are presented in this paper. This work shows that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CASIA, achieves comparable result on REPLAY-ATTACK and reduces model complexity by exploiting few key features of liveness. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Nowadays, cloud computing has provided enterprises and users with several capabilities to process and store their data in various cloud data centers. Storing and processing these sensitive data with better protection and management are a big challenge. Therefore, there is a need for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of data in the cloud without any information leakage. Recently, biometric recognition has achieved significant advancements in the identification of individuals for the purpose of privacy-preservation in the cloud computing. Only few works have used a face as a typical biometric trait for cloud and cross-enterprise identification in the last recent years. However, current cloud-based biometric identification systems and approaches have some limitations such as noisy data, inter and intra class variations, high time cost, inaccurate, non-universality and spoofing attack. This paper proposes a new anti-spoof multispectral biometric cloud-based identification approach for privacy and security of cloud computing. The approach offers the solution using multi-spectral palmprint as a typical biometric trait between two main phases: offline enrollment phase and online identification phase. This work is considered the first approach of privacy-preservation in cloud computing using encrypted multi-spectral palmprint features without any information leakage and disclosure possibility. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can accurately and efficiently provide the privacy and security of cloud data. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Many prior face anti-spoofing works develop discriminative models for recognizing the subtle differences between live and spoof faces. Those approaches often regard the image as an indivisible unit, and process it holistically, without explicit modeling of the spoofing process. In this work, motivated by the noise modeling and denoising algorithms, we identify a new problem of face de-spoofing, for the purpose of anti-spoofing: inversely decomposing a spoof face into a spoof noise and a live face, and then utilizing the spoof noise for classification. A CNN architecture with proper constraints and supervisions is proposed to overcome the problem of having no ground truth for the decomposition. We evaluate the proposed method on multiple face anti-spoofing databases. The results show promising improvements due to our spoof noise modeling. Moreover, the estimated spoof noise provides a visualization which helps to understand the added spoof noise by each spoof medium. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.

AB  - 3D mask spoofing attack has been one of the main challenges in face recognition. A real face displays a different motion behaviour compared to a 3D mask spoof attempt, which is reflected by different facial dynamic textures. However, the different dynamic information usually exists in the subtle texture level, which cannot be fully differentiated by traditional hand-crafted texture-based methods. In this paper, we propose a novel method for 3D mask face anti-spoofing, namely deep convolutional dynamic texture learning, which learns robust dynamic texture information from fine-grained deep convolutional features. Moreover, channel-discriminability constraint is adaptively incorporated to weight the discriminability of feature channels in the learning process. Experiments on both public datasets validate that the proposed method achieves promising results under intra and cross dataset scenario. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - In this work, we focused on liveness detection for facial recognition system's spoofing via fake face movement. We have developed a pupil direction observing system for anti-spoofing in face recognition systems using a basic hardware equipment. Firstly, eye area is being extracted from real time camera by using Haar-Cascade Classifier with specially trained classifier for eye region detection. Feature points have extracted and traced for minimizing person's head movements and getting stable eye region by using Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) algorithm. Eye area is being cropped from real time camera frame and rotated for a stable eye area. Pupils are extracted from eye area by using a new improved algorithm subsequently. After a few stable number of frames that has pupils, proposed spoofing algorithm selects a random direction and sends a signal to Arduino to activate that selected direction's LED on a square frame that has totally eight LEDs for each direction. After chosen LED has been activated, eye direction is observed whether pupil direction and LED's position matches. If the compliance requirement is satisfied, algorithm returns data that contains liveness information. Complete algorithm for liveness detection using pupil tracking is tested on volunteers and algorithm achieved high success ratio. © 2017 IEEE.

The features in a human ear are more reliable than other physical traits like fingerprint, face, palm print, etc. In this paper, we propose an efficient ear pattern sensor by introducing a new imaging technique that is capable of simultaneous retrieval of the topographic details as well as its liveliness information. In the proposed technique, a collimated laser beam is made incident on a sinusoidal grating, and the resultant structured pattern is projected towards the ear specimen. For detection of topographic information and liveliness, time series bio-speckled fringe sequences are recorded using a CCD camera. For noise removal and shape reconstruction from the acquired information, a combination of windowed Fourier filtering and low pass filtering is used. Discrete cosine transform based fast biospeckle algorithm is introduced for assessment of genuineness (i.e. to create distinction between real and fake samples) of the specimen. The proposed sensor is simple, compact, full-field and robust against different spoof attacks. © 2018

AB  - Due to advances in technology, today's biometric systems become vulnerable to spoof attacks made by fake faces. These attacks occur when an intruder attempts to fool an established face-based recognition system by presenting a fake face (e.g., print photo or replay attacks) in front of the camera instead of the intruder's genuine face. For this purpose, face antispoofing has become a hot topic in face analysis literature, where several applications with antispoofing task have emerged recently. We propose a solution for distinguishing between real faces and fake ones. Our approach is based on extracting features from the difference between successive frames instead of individual frames. We also used a multilevel representation that divides the frame difference into multiple multiblocks. Different texture descriptors (local binary patterns, local phase quantization, and binarized statistical image features) have then been applied to each block. After the feature extraction step, a Fisher score is applied to sort the features in ascending order according to the associated weights. Finally, a support vector machine is used to differentiate between real and fake faces. We tested our approach on three publicly available databases: CASIA Face Antispoofing database, Replay-Attack database, and MSU Mobile Face Spoofing database. The proposed approach outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods in different media and quality metrics. © 2017 SPIE and IS&T.

AB  - Todays biometric systems are vulnerable to spoof attacks made by non-real faces. The problem is when a person shows in front of camera a print photo or a picture from cell phone. We study in this paper an anti-spoofing solution for distinguishing between 'live' and 'fake' faces. In our approach we used overlapping block LBP operator to extract features in each region of the image. To reduce the features we used Fisher-Score. Finally, we used a nonlinear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with kernel function for determining whether the input image corresponds to a live face or not. Our experimental analysis on a publicly available NUAA and CASIA face anti-spoofing databases following the standard protocols showed good results. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Face anti-spoofing is designed to keep face recognition systems from recognizing fake faces as the genuine users. While advanced face anti-spoofing methods are developed, new types of spoof attacks are also being created and becoming a threat to all existing systems. We define the detection of unknown spoof attacks as Zero-Shot Face Anti-spoofing (ZSFA). Previous works of ZSFA only study 1-2 types of spoof attacks, such as print/replay attacks, which limits the insight of this problem. In this work, we expand the ZSFA problem to a wide range of 13 types of spoof attacks, including print attack, replay attack, 3D mask attacks, and so on. A novel Deep Tree Network (DTN) is proposed to tackle the ZSFA. The tree is learned to partition the spoof samples into semantic sub-groups in an unsupervised fashion. When a data sample arrives, being know or unknown attacks, DTN routes it to the most similar spoof cluster, and make the binary decision. In addition, to enable the study of ZSFA, we introduce the first face anti-spoofing database that contains diverse types of spoof attacks. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves the state of the art on multiple testing protocols of ZSFA. © 2019 IEEE.

N1  - Funding text 1: This paper tackles the zero-shot face antispoofing problem among 13 types of spoof attacks. The proposed method leverages a deep tree network to route the unknown attacks to the most proper leaf node for spoof detection. The tree is trained in an unsupervised fashion to find the feature base with the largest variation to split the spoof data. We collect SiW-M that contains more subjects and spoof types than any previous databases. Finally, we experimentally show superior performance of the proposed method.

AB  - Face anti-spoofing is an important task in full-stack face applications including face detection, verification, and recognition. Previous approaches build models on datasets which do not simulate the real-world data well (e.g., small scale, insignificant variance, etc.). Existing models may rely on auxiliary information, which prevents these anti-spoofing solutions from generalizing well in practice. In this paper, we present a data collection solution along with a data synthesis technique to simulate digital medium-based face spoofing attacks, which can easily help us obtain a large amount of training data well reflecting the real-world scenarios. Through exploiting a novel Spatio-Temporal Anti-Spoof Network (STASN), we are able to push the performance on public face anti-spoofing datasets over state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Since the proposed model can automatically attend to discriminative regions, it makes analyzing the behaviors of the network possible.We conduct extensive experiments and show that the proposed model can distinguish spoof faces by extracting features from a variety of regions to seek out subtle evidences such as borders, moire patterns, reflection artifacts, etc. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, a smart face liveness detector is proposed to prevent the biometric system from being “deceived” by the video or picture of a valid user that the counterfeiter took with a high definition handheld device (e.g., iPad with retina display). By analyzing the characteristics of the display platform and using an expert decision-making core, we can effectively detect whether a spoofing action comes from a fake face displayed in the high definition display by verifying the chromaticity regions in the captured face. That is, a live or spoof face can be distinguished precisely by the designed optical image sensor. To sum up, by the proposed method/system, a normal optical image sensor can be upgraded to a powerful version to detect the spoofing actions. The experimental results prove that the proposed detection system can achieve very high detection rate compared to the existing methods and thus be practical to implement directly in the authentication systems. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - In this paper I will present a technique to generate a digital signature for an image, which will uniquely identify it, using Radon transform. Even if Radon based approaches are broadly applicable to tomography (the construction of an image from the projection data related with cross-sectional scans of it), in this research work I will show how it can be successfully utilized to classify images and detect face spoof attacks. This increased popularity of face recognition system has raised disquiets about biometric attacks, where a photo of an authorized person's face could be used by unauthorized individuals to access diverse services. The presented results prove this method offers similar performances to the state of the art and they were obtained using MATLAB 2013 environment and NUAA Photograph Imposter Database. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - RFID has been widely adopted in access control as an identity identification technology. This system can be combined with the face recognition technique to avoid the RFID is used by unauthorized people. However, this approach also suffers a drawback that someone may try to deceive the security system by presenting a photo of the real card owner. In this paper, we propose a method ensuring that such kind of spoof can be rejected. After a frontal face has been detected, the facial object will be tracked by optical flow algorithm until a profile is detected. Experimental results show that the proposed mechanism can improve the validity of the access control system effectively. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - Anti-spoofing protection of biometric systems is always a serious issue in real-life applications of an automatic personal verification system. Despite the fact that face image is the most common way of identifying persons and one of the most popular modalities in automatic biometric authentication, little attention has been given to the spoof resistance of face verification algorithms. In this paper, we discuss how a system based on DCT features with a likelihood-ratio-based classifier can be easily spoofed by adding white Gaussian noise to the test image. We propose a strategy to address this problem by measuring the quality of the test image and of the extracted features before making a verification decision. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.

AB  - In the recent days, the facial biometric system is widely used for the mobile payments and other surveillance systems. Its popularity is going to be increased because of its easiness to use and also it is user friendly. But the main problem in this system is its vulnerability to the spoof attacks made by 2D or 3D face masks or printed photographs. In order to guard against face spoofing, the anti-spoofing methods have been developed to do liveliness detection. In this paper, the different type of face spoofing attacks and the different techniques used for anti-spoofing are analyzed. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Biometrics is extensively used for person identification for various security applications. However existing systems using single biometric modality do not provide required level of accuracy and robustness. Combining various biometric modalities has proved to be more efficient in terms of enhancing accuracy. Verification using palm print modality has definitely achieved a great success as a unique and reliable biometric characteristic. Still the demand of robust and highly accurate biometric system can not be fulfilled using only palm print modality. The combined use of palm print and palm vein modality can substantially increase the robustness, anti-spoof capability and accuracy of the system. This paper presents a multimodal biometric identification system based on the fusion of Palm print and Palm vein modalities of the human hand. Here in the first module, the hand image is first preprocessed and its palm print features are extracted using wavelet decomposition technique. Palm vein features are extracted using matched filter technique. For every modality, separate matcher is used for recognition. Decisions obtained by both the matchers are logically ANDed together to recognize the person. Module 1 gives 96% accuracy with zero FAR. In the second module, a rough-to-fine hierarchical feature matching is done for efficient hand recognition. Module 2 gives 97.25% accuracy with very low FAR. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Face biometrics plays an important role in various authentication applications. However, one of the main design challenges for an accurate face biometrics is detecting spoof artificial artifacts. The development of robust anti-spoofing algorithm requires for rigorous system training and testing on facial database that includes various possible spoof specimen which reflects different variations of spoofing attacks. Currently, the databases which are used to test face anti-spoofing algorithms are limited in terms of texture variations. Therefore, in this paper, our focus is to introduce a face spoofing database which is compiled from various types of spoofing textures. Our database was collected from 30 different subjects and fake faces were recaptured on various forms which include four different types of paper-based textures and three different digital display devices. All images were collected using a high precision camera device. This database would provide a more realistic and challenging platform for facial anti-spoofing research. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Face anti-spoofing has become a vital element for guaranteeing the security of face recognition systems. Previous face anti-spoofing approaches generally exploit cues in visible light images or near-infrared images individually. Few studies pay attention to fusing visible light and near-infrared images for face anti-spoofing. However, the strengths and weaknesses of visible light images and near-infrared images for face anti-spoofing can be complementary. In this study, we introduce a new face anti-spoofing dataset named as CIGIT-PPM, which includes paired visible light and near-infrared images with spoofing medium, distance, pose, expression and session variations for both print and 3D mask attacks. Further, we propose a novel fusing paired visible light and near-infrared spectral images CNN based approach for face anti-spoofing, combining the discriminating ability of both visible light and near-infrared spectral images. Specifically, an end-to-end CNN is employed to learn fusing representation from paired images and do classification at multilevel, and then weight averaged strategy is utilized to integrate the classification probability of different levels, which gives the final result that the input paired images are captured from a live face or a spoof face. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on self-collected dataset CIGIT-PPM and public dataset msspoof. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Even though biometric technology increases the security of systems that use it, they are prone to spoof attacks where attempts of fraudulent biometrics are used. To overcome these risks, techniques on detecting liveness of the biometric measure are employed. For example, in systems that utilise face authentication as biometrics, a liveness is assured using an estimation of blood flow, or analysis of quality of the face image. Liveness assurance of the face using real depth technique is rarely used in biometric devices and in the literature, even with the availability of depth datasets. Therefore, this technique of employing 3D cameras for liveness of face authentication is underexplored for its vulnerabilities to spoofing attacks. This research reviews the literature on this aspect and then evaluates the liveness detection to suggest solutions that account for the weaknesses found in detecting spoofing attacks. We conduct a proof-of-concept study to assess the liveness detection of 3D cameras in three devices, where the results show that having more flexibility resulted in achieving a higher rate in detecting spoofing attacks. Nonetheless, it was found that selecting a wide depth range of the 3D camera is important for anti-spoofing security recognition systems such as surveillance cameras used in airports. Therefore, to utilise the depth information and implement techniques that detect faces regardless of the distance, a 3D camera with long maximum depth range (e.g., 20 m) and high resolution stereo cameras could be selected, which can have a positive impact on accuracy. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Due to their advantages, facial recognition systems are among the most widely used biometric systems in recent years. However, their drawback is that they can easily be deceived by using 3D masks, which are replicas of real faces. To confirm this fact, we have tested the vulnerability to 3D masks attacks of the already approved Legendre moments invariants (LMI)-based face recognition method. This has been achieved by using the 3D mask attack database (3DMAD), which consists of real faces and faces with 3D masks. The obtained spoof false acceptance rate (SFAR) was close to 65%, which proves that this recognition system is vulnerable to 3D masks attacks. This is generally the case of other face recognition systems, with no anti-spoofing provision. In this paper, a face recognition method is proposed to prevent hackers from deceiving face recognition systems by using 3D masks of people belonging to the system database. This method combines the LMI and the linear discriminant analysis for characteristic features extraction, and the maximum likelihood for classification. With a 97.6% recognition rate and a SFAR equal to 0.83%, the results obtained may be considered as very satisfactory. These results, while obtained with a lower computational time, compare favorably with those of the state-of-the-art method that uses the same 3DMAD database. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - With the growing deployment of face recognition system in recent years, face anti-spoofing has become increasingly important, due to the increasing number of spoofing attacks via printed photos or replayed videos. Motivated by the powerful representation ability of deep learning, in this paper we propose to use CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) to learn multiple deep features from different cues of the face images for anti-spoofing. We integrate temporal features, color based features and patch based local features for spoof detection. We evaluate our approach extensively on publicly available databases like CASIA FASD, REPLAY-MOBILE and OULU-NPU. The experimental results show that our approach can achieve much better performance than state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, 2.22% of EER (Equal Error Rate) on the CASIA FASD, 3.2% of ACER (Average Classification Error Rate) on the OULU-NPU (protocol 1) and 0.00% of ACER on the REPLAY-MOBILE database are achieved. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.

AB  - Nowadays face recognition system usage is increasing day by day to provide better security mechanism. But with the face recognition system, there are some spoofing methods also attached using which the system can be befooled easily. These attacks are simple and easy as they cost less and the images can also be easily retrieved from social sites; therefore there are high chances of them to be successful. . Still there is a scarcity of a productive anti-spoofing algorithm to resolve this issue. The aim of this paper is to present a method which can be used for identification of the spoof. A method is proposed which takes the live video streaming input from the user and perform Liveness detection on the user based on the eye blinking movement and for face feature extraction Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) is used as it proves to be an effective feature descriptor in the face recognition. Two classifiers k Nearest Neighbour (kNN) and Neural Network (NN) are used for the classification purpose. The work is performed on the self created Database and implementation is performed in MATLAB for better understanding, visualization and programming. The performance results of the kNN and NN classifier are compared and finally it is concluded that which classifier outperforms the other one. ©2016ACM.

AB  - Automatically recognising people by their biometric characteristics is a well-established research area. Biometric systems are vulnerable to many different types of presentation attacks made by persons showing photo, video, or mask to spoof the real identity. This study introduces a novel approach to detect face-spoofing, by extracting the local features local binary pattern (LBP) and simplified weber local descriptor (SWLD) encoded convolutional neural network (CNN) models, WLD and LBP features are combined together to ensure the preservation of the local intensity information and the orientations of the edges. These two components are complementary to each other. Specifically, differential excitation preserves the local intensity information but omits the orientations of edges. On the contrary, LBP describes the orientations of the edges but ignore the intensity information, the proposed approach presents a very low degree of complexity which makes it suitable for real-time applications, Finally, a non-linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier with kernel function was used for determining whether the input image corresponds to a live face or not. Authors' experimental analysis on two publicly available databases REPLAYATTACK and CASIA face anti-spoofing showed that their approach performs better than state-of-the-art techniques following the provided evaluation protocols of each database. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2019.

When somebody attempts to take on the appearance of another person by introducing a phony face or video before the face detection camera and gets illegitimate access, a face presentation attack usually happens. To effectively protect the privacy of a person, it is very critical to build a face authentication and anti-spoofing system. This paper introduces a novel and appealing face spoof detection technique, which is primarily based on the study of contrast and dynamic texture features of both seized and spoofed photos. Valid identification of photo spoofing is anticipated here. A modified version of the DoG filtering method, and local binary pattern variance (LBPV) based technique, which is invariant to rotation, are designated to be used in this paper. Support vector machine (SVM) is used when feature vectors are extracted for further analysis. The publicly available NUAA photo-imposter database is adapted to test the system, which includes facial images with different illumination and area. The accuracy of the method can be assessed using the false acceptance rate (FAR) and false rejection rate (FRR). The results express that our method performs better on key indices compared to other state-of-the-art techniques following the provided evaluation protocols tested on a similar dataset. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The ability to offer remote access to services or data through various platforms has become a public expectation of many applications and systems nowadays. Recently, we can see the growth in trend where wide range of service providers offer the option to use biometric as a form of authentication, replacing conventional password system. While we gradually migrate towards such authentication method, it is important not to overlook the vulnerabilities of such systems to spoof attack. In fact, spoof attack must be prevented as a mandatory prerequisite in all biometric systems. In this paper, we present a systematic approach for face authentication that incorporates state-of-the-art liveness detection and face verification algorithms to safeguard a system against such attack. We explore and examine the feasibility of the application of such approach on generic devices and systems without incurring hardware dependencies or requiring extensive user-cooperation. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Despite a great deal of progress in face Recognition technologies, current solutions are still vulnerable to spoof attacks. In fact, it is easy to access digital replicas of facial biometric information from readily available photos, videos and 3D masks. The literature contains several face anti spoofing methods that try to detect whether the face in the front of the Recognition system is real or an artificial replica. However, these methods are not robust and require many improvements since they are sensitive to lightening conditions and pose variations. In order to address these issues, we propose a novel face anti spoofing method based on Multi Color Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture named DeepColorFASD. Our approach investigates the effect of space colors (RGB, HSV and Y CbCr) on CNN architectures and proposes a fusion based voting method for face anti spoofing. In addition, we also explain the resulting feature maps visualizations. We evaluate our system through an experimental study using CASIA FASD: a well-known face anti spoofing database. The results using this challenging database demonstrate that our solution performs better than recent works as measured by Half Total Error Rate (HTER) and ROC curve. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Conventional face anti-spoofing paradigms tend to operate on plain facial profiles and learn either the natural face space alone (one-class training problem) or both the natural face space as well as the spoof sample space (2-class training problem). However, this rigidity with respect to spatially constrained measurements, makes the base feature or statistic vulnerable to noise related to pose and camera perspective/orientational and scale changes. Noting that the sharpness profile computed on a natural face is largely independent of the pose and perspective change, it is imperative that the measurements be extracted in an identity independent setting by ignoring the pose/perspective variation. To facilitate this, we have deployed a 2-dimensional random walk for capturing lower order pixel correlation statistics from natural faces, with virtually no perceptual interference. The proposed identity independent frame has surpassed the state of the art with reference to a 3D mask dataset (image oriented, isolated frame setting), with an EER of $$2.25\%$$ without auto-population and an EER of $$0.45\%$$ with auto-population. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The recognition frameworks are highly vulnerable to spoofing attacks and this vulnerability generates an effective security concerned issues in biometric domain. Moreover, some of the earlier proposed approaches have attained attractive results with intra test (i.e. by training and testing the system on same database) evaluation done to detect the face spoofing attack. Consequently, most of these techniques generate incorrect decision on the recognition of genuine faces with unseen attacks in case of inter test evaluation (i.e. the system is trained on one database and then tested on another database). However, this impact is considered as a major difficulty in the highly focused biometric anti-spoofing research domain. In this work, we propose a multimodal biometric framework for the accurate recognition of fake face from genuine face. Initially, face image features which are coupled to the color spaces HSV and YCbCr are extracted with EDGHM-SURF (Enhanced Discrete Gaussian-Hermite Moment based Speed-up Robust Feature) descriptor. Then, a newly developed method of feature-level fusion using OGWO (FLFO) is used to fuse these extracted features. This method utilized the OGWO (Oppositional Gray Wolf Optimization) algorithm due to its excellent exploitation and exploration behavior in the identification of optimal weight score from the solution space, without allowing the solutions to stick in the local optimum. Finally, the fused features are fed into the Layered k-SVM (k-support vector machine) classifier for the recognition of fake face. The experimental results of our proposed approach are evaluated on three traditional benchmark face spoofing databases, namely the Replay-Attack, the CASIA Face Anti-Spoofing, and the MSU Mobile Face Spoof database. The outcome of our proposed approach exhibited steady and robust performance across all the three datasets. More commonly, our proposed approach executes well in the inter database tests and yields high performance, even though when only operated with minimized training data. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Face recognition systems are widely known for their vulnerability against presentation attacks or spoofing attacks. The exponential deployment of face recognition systems has been further challenged even by the simple and low-cost face artefacts generated using conventional printers. In this paper, we present a novel scheme to detect face presentation attacks posed by high-quality print attacks which are relatively difficult to detect. The proposed scheme leverages the phase information extracted from the spatial-frequency representation of the given image. We also present a new face presentation attack database collected using the iPhone 6S. The new database is comprised of 100 subjects collected in two different sessions that have resulted in a total of 31228 samples (or images). Extensive experiments are carried out on the newly constructed database and the obtained results show the improved performance of the proposed scheme when compared aaainst six different state-of-the-art methods. © 2018 ISIF

AB  - As security problem has become the tightest bottleneck in the application of face recognition systems, rendering a face recognition system robust against spoof attacks is of great significance to be dealt with. In this paper, aimed at video-based facial spoof attacks, an innovative face antispoofing algorithm based on local binary patterns (LBP) and multilayer discrete cosine transform (DCT) is proposed. First, we extract face images from a target video at a fixed time interval. Second, the low-level descriptors, i.e., the LBP features are generated for each extracted face image. After that, we perform multilayer DCT on the low-level descriptors to obtain the high-level descriptors (LBP-MDCT features). To be more exact, in each layer, the DCT operation is implemented along the ordinate axis of the obtained low-level descriptors, namely the time axis of the entire target video. In the last stage, the high-level descriptors are fed into a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to determine whether the target video is a spoof attack or a valid access. In contrast to existing approaches, the outstanding experimental results attained by the proposed approach on two widely-used datasets (Replay-Attack dataset and CASIA-FASD dataset) demonstrat its performance superiority as well as its low complexity and high efficiency. © 2018, Science Press.

AB  - Most of the generic camera based biometrics systems, such as face recognition systems, are vulnerable to print/photo attacks. Spoof detection, which is to discriminate between live biometric information and attacks, has received increasing attentions recently. However, almost all the previous studies have not concerned the influence of the image distortion caused by the camera defocus or hand movements during image capturing. In this research, we first investigate local texture based anti-spoofing methods including existing popular methods (but changing some of the parameters) by using publicly available spoofed face/finger photo/video databases. Secondly, we investigate the spoof detection under the camera defocus or hand movements during image capturing. To simulate image distortion caused by camera defocus or hand movements, we create blurred test images by applying image filters (Gaussian blur or motion blur filters) to the test datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that modifications of the existing methods (LBP, LPQ, DCNN) or the parameter tuning can achieve less than 1/10 of HTER（half total error rate）compared to the existing results. Among the investigated methods, the DCNN (AlexNet) can achieve the stable accuracy under the increasing intensity of the blurring noises.

AB  - Today iris recognition systems are extensively used for security and authentication purposes due to their simplicity and high reliability. But these systems face a major challenge of being spoofed by high quality printed iris images or pictures captured by camera. The problem is aggravated by use of varying illumination conditions in an attack access attempt. This paper investigates spoofing attempts and suggests a simple approach based on statistical parameters to counter against such attacks in the event of varying illumination sources. Self Quotient Image (SQI) is used to combat varying lighting conditions. A feature score is computed based on the statistical parameters. A binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used to classify the image under test as real or spoof by matching the feature score of the trained images to that of the test image. The experimental results show that the proposed method performs better than other state-of-the-art techniques. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - A person intentionally concealing or faking their identity from biometric security systems is known to perform a 'presentation attack'. Efficient presentation attack detection poses a challenging problem in modern biometric security systems. Sophisticated presentation attacks may successfully spoof a person's face and therefore, disrupt accurate biometric authentication in controlled areas. In this work, a presentation attack detection technique which processes biologically-inspired facial features is introduced. The main goal of the proposed method is to provide an alternative foundation for biometric detection systems. In addition, such a system can be used for future generation biometric systems capable of carrying out rapid facial perception tasks in complex and dynamic situations. The newly-developed model was tested against two different databases and classifiers. Presentation attack detection results have shown promise, exceeding 94% detection accuracy on average for the investigated databases. The proposed model can be enriched with future enhancements that can further improve its effectiveness and complexity in more diverse situations and sophisticated attacks in the real world. © 2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

AB  - Face recognition technology has been applied extensively in many fields, such as biometric authentication. However, its application is not widely popularized since its anti-spoofing performance is very deficient. A real-time facial expression recognition algorithm is proposed to realize face liveness detection in this paper, and the anti-spoofing performance can be effectively enhanced. After the face and the preset facial expression are properly recognized, the algorithm requires the user to change to another randomly designated expression. According to the second facial expression recognition result, it can judge the face image whether is captured from a live face. The four facial expressions, which have high recognition rate and the user is willing to accept and easily represent, are selected to verify the validity of the algorithm. The experiment shows the algorithm can effectively prevent the spoof attacks using photo, 3D model and video. © 2014 Binary Information Press

AB  - In the race of arms between attackers, trying to build more and more realistic face replay attacks, and defenders, deploying spoof detection modules with ever-increasing capabilities, CNN-based methods have shown outstanding detection performance thus raising the bar for the construction of realistic replay attacks against face-based authentication systems. Rather than trying to rebroadcast even more realistic faces, we show that attackers can successfully fool a face authentication system equipped with a deep learning spoof detection module, by exploiting the vulnerabilities of CNNs to adversarial perturbations. We first show that mounting such an attack is not a trivial task due to the unique features of spoofing detection modules. Then, we propose a method to craft adversarial images that can be successfully exploited to build an effective replay attack. Experiments conducted on the REPLAY-MOBILE database demonstrate that our attacked images achieve good performance against a face recognition system equipped with CNN-based anti-spoofing, in that they are able to pass the face detection, spoof detection and face recognition modules of the authentication chain. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Reflection differences between live faces and spoof faces under near-infrared spectrum make near-infrared image based methods obtain superior performance for face anti-spoofing. However, for conventional face recognition systems, near-infrared image based methods need additional near-infrared equipment to capture the input near-infrared images. In this paper, we propose a novel face anti-spoofing method which exploits the clues in both visible light (VIS) images and near-infrared (NIR) images without utilizing any near-infrared equipment during testing. Specifically, we first propose a novel multiple categories image translation generative adversarial network (MCT-GAN) which generates corresponding NIR images for VIS live and spoof face images. Then we utilize convolution neural network to learn fusing features from both VIS images and corresponding generated NIR images for the goal of live and spoof face classification. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method obtains excellent results compared to the state-of-the-art methods. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - One of the most generally used framework to recognize the authorized person based on behavioral or physical characteristics is the Biometric system. One of the present issues with this system is that it can be easily spoofed. A spoofing attack is nothing but a situation in which a person or a program successfully identifies themselves as another person in order to use the system without the permission of authorized user thus harming or attacking the biometric recognition system. The biometric system can be easily spoofed by methods such as using face images of the authorized person, masks or videos which are easily available on social media these days. In this analysis, categorization of face liveness detection is done based on different techniques used for detecting spoofing attacks. This helps in inferring various developed solutions and spoofing attacks associated with them. An investigation of late examinations in the field of face liveness discovery has been laided to provide a simple and clear path for future improvement in the field of face liveness detection. © 2020, Hampstead Psychological Associates.

AB  - In this paper, a face spoofing detection method called the Fully Convolutional Network with Domain Adaptation and Lossless Size Adaptation (FCN-DA-LSA) is proposed. As its name suggests, the FCN-DA-LSA includes a lossless size adaptation preprocessor followed by an FCN based pixel-level classifier embedded with a domain adaptation layer. The FCN local classifier makes full use of the basic properties of face spoof distortion namely ubiquitous and repetitive. The domain adaptation (DA) layer improves generalization across different domains. The lossless size adaptation (LSA) preserves the high-frequent spoof clues caused by the face recapture process. The ablation study shows that both DA and the LSA are necessary for high-accuracy face spoofing detection. The FCN-LSA obtains competitive performance among the state-of-the-art methods. With the help of small-sample external data in the target domain (2/50, 2/50, and 1/20 subjects for CASIA-FASD, Replay-Attack, and OULU-NPU respectively), the FCN-DA-LSA further improves the performance and outperforms the existing methods. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Face recognition systems are vulnerable to the presentation (or spoof or direct) attacks that can be carried out by presenting the face artefact corresponding to the legitimate user. Thus, it is essential to develop a Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) algorithms that can automatically detect the presentation attacks the face recognition systems. In this paper, we present a novel method for face presentation attack detection based on the multi-classifier fusion of deep features that are computed using the off-the-shelf pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture based on AlexNet. Extracted features are compared using softmax and Spectral Regression Kernel Discriminant Analysis (SRKDA) classifiers to obtain the comparison scores that are combined using a weighted sum rule. Extensive experiments are carried out on the publicly available OULU-NPU database and performance of the proposed method is benchmarked with fifteen different state-of-the-art techniques. Obtained results have indicated the outstanding performance of the proposed method on OULU-NPU database. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.

AB  - Existing architectures used in face anti-spoofing tend to deploy registered spatial measurements to generate feature vectors for spoof detection. This means that the ordering or sequence in which specific statistics are computed cannot be changed, as one moves from one facial profile to another.While this arrangement works in a person-specific setting, it becomes a major drawback when single-sided training is done based on the natural face class alone. To mitigate subject identity linked content interference within the anti-spoofing frame, we propose a identity-independent architecture based on random correlated scans of natural face images. The same natural face image can be scanned multiple times through independent correlated random walks before deriving simple differential features on the 1D scanned vectors.This proposed frame tends to capture the pixel correlation statistics with minimal content interference and shows great promise, particularly when trained on natural face sets, using a one-class support vector machine and cross-validated on other databases. Performance measured in terms of EER for detection of spoof face is found to be 3.8291 % with proposed random scan features, and 2.02 % with auto-population samples for inter database. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In past few decades, the development of the biometric identification techniques, such as fingerprint, iris, finger vein, and so on, has become quite mature and related applications have become very popular. The advance of GPU acceleration techniques and the impact of deep neural networks increase not only the accuracy, but also the popularity of face recognition systems. Although face recognition systems alleviate the problem of person identification, their applications would reveal a new challenging task, that is face spoofing and presentation attacks. No matter in a form of photos, videos, or 3D masks, face spoofing attacks can not only restrict the application of a face recognition system, but also increase its vulnerability in regard of security issues. Consequently, in this paper, a deep neural network scheme for face anti-spoofing and liveness detection is proposed to prevent the existing face recognition systems from common face spoofing attacks. The experimental results have demonstrated the robustness of the proposed method against print, cut, and replay attacks. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Face anti-spoofing detection is critical to guarantee the security of biometric face recognition systems. Despite extensive advances in facial anti-spoofing based on single-model image, little work has been devoted to multi-modal anti-spoofing, which is however widely encountered in real-world scenarios. Following the recent progress, this paper mainly focuses on multi-modal face antispoofing and aims to solve the following two challenges: (1) how to effectively fuse multi-modal information; and (2) how to effectively learn distinguishable features despite single cross-entropy loss. We propose a novel Multi-modal Multi-layer Fusion Convolutional Neural Network (mmfCNN), which targets at finding a discriminative model for recognizing the subtle differences between live and spoof faces. The mmfCNN can fully use different information provided by diverse modalities, which is based on a weight-adaptation aggregation approach. Specifically, we utilize a multi-layer fusion model to further aggregate the features from different layers, which fuses the low-, mid- and high-level information from different modalities in a unified framework. Moreover, a novel Average Binary Center (ABC) loss is proposed to maximize the dissimilarity between the features of live and spoof faces, which helps to stabilize the training to generate a robust and discriminative model. Extensive experiments conducted on the CISIA-SURF and 3DMAD datasets verify the significance and generalization capability of the proposed method for the face anti-spoofing task.

AB  - In applications of cyberspace security, face liveness detection is significant for face recognition systems. In this paper, an innovative face anti-spoofing algorithm against video-based face spoofing attacks is proposed based on local binary patterns and multilayer discrete cosine transform (LBP-MDCT) and convolutional neural network (CNN). First, we first extract face images from a target video, generate LBP features for each extracted face image and perform multilayer DCT onto the features to obtain LBP-MDCT features. Second, we input part of face images into CNN to obtain CNN features. After that, the two types of features are respectively input into support vector machine (SVM) classifier. In the last stage, the SVM output is fused with a decision-level operation to determine whether the target video is a spoof attack or a valid access. Compared with existing algorithms, the experimental results on two benchmarking datasets (Replay-Attack dataset and CASIAFASD dataset) demonstrate the excellent effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2019, Editorial Office of Journal of Applied Sciences.

AB  - To create security frameworks, numerous biometric frameworks are proposed to protect a spoof attack. Face recognition (FR) is one of the most broadly utilized innovations. One of the principle issues of utilizing FR is that the frameworks can easily get attacked by spoof faces. To avoid these attacks by spoof faces and to improve the accuracy of FR frameworks, numerous anti spoofing techniques are available. A protected system needs Liveness Detection in order to shield against such spoofing. The paper proposes liveness detection to identify the spoofing attack. The implemented system basically depends on some statistical face feature along with KNN classifier to identify fake faces. The system shows improved accuracy compared with algorithms in the literature. © 2019 IJSTR.

AB  - Recently facial recognition Technology are being habitual for various access control requirements and spoof detection in such a system has drawn growing attention. In this paper, we represent by comparison analysis of different local descriptors and off the shelf deep networks for feature extraction- Local Binary Pattern (LBP), SIFT, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Shallow CNN, VGG16 and Inception-Resnet-V2 for face spoofing detection. Furthermore, we evaluated three Classifiers-Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) over the feature extracted through local descriptors and deep networks. The evaluation has been conducted using publicly available YALE face database containing real and fake facial images. Real dataset consists of 5121 entries and fake dataset has 7508 images. The analysis results demonstrate that the best prediction accuracy of real and spoof is obtained with Inception_ResnetV2 features when classified with ANN and about 96.23% accuracy is achieved. © BEIESP.

AB  - Face anti-spoofing is an important topic of face recognition system to protect against security breach. Previous approach for face spoofing detection based on distortion in images have achieved promising results. However, their generalization ability has not been sufficiently addressed. In this work, we propose a face spoofing detection based on color distortion analysis, which captures the chromatic aberration from a face image. Color distortion analysis extracts color moment and ranked histogram features, which generate 116 feature vector. The feature vector then forwarded to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to perform dimensionality reduction. For classifying a live or spoof face image, a Naïve Bayes classifier performed on the principal components obtained from PCA. From experiment, the proposed method achieves competitive performance compared to previous approach, with the highest TPR (True Positive Rate) is 97.4%. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Face anti-spoofing detection is a crucial procedure in biometric face recognition systems. State-of-the-art approaches, based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), present good results in this field. However, previous works focus on one single modal data with limited number of subjects. The recently published CASIA-SURF dataset is the largest dataset that consists of 1000 subjects and 21000 video clips with 3 modalities (RGB, Depth and IR). In this paper, we propose a multi-stream CNN architecture called FaceBagNet to make full use of this data. The input of FaceBagNet is patch-level images which contributes to extract spoof-specific discriminative information. In addition, in order to prevent overfitting and for better learning the fusion features, we design a Modal Feature Erasing (MFE) operation on the multi-modal features which erases features from one randomly selected modality during training. As the result, our approach wins the second place in CVPR 2019 ChaLearn Face Anti-spoofing attack detection challenge. Our final submission gets the score of 99.8052% (TPR@FPR = 10e-4) on the test set. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Face anti-spoofing is crucial for the security of face recognition systems. Learning based methods especially deep learning based methods need large-scale training samples to reduce overfitting. However, acquiring spoof data is very expensive since the live faces should be reprinted and re-captured in many views. In this paper, we present a method to synthesize virtual spoof data in 3D space to alleviate this problem. Specifically, we consider a printed photo as a flat surface and mesh it into a 3D object, which is then randomly bent and rotated in 3D space. Afterward, the transformed 3D photo is rendered through perspective projection as a virtual sample. The synthetic virtual samples can significantly boost the anti-spoofing performance when combined with a proposed data balancing strategy. Our promising results open up new possibilities for advancing face anti-spoofing using cheap and large-scale synthetic data. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Face spoofing attacks have received significant attention because of criminals who are developing different techniques such as warped photos, cut photos, 3D masks, etc. to easily fool the face recognition systems. In order to improve the security measures of biometric systems, deep learning models offer powerful solutions; but to attain the benefits of multilayer features remains a significant challenge. To alleviate this limitation, this paper presents a hybrid framework to build the feature representation by fusing ResNet with more discriminative power. First, two variants of the residual learning framework are selected as deep feature extractors to extract informative features. Second, the fullyconnected layers are used as separated feature descriptors. Third, PCA based Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is proposed as a feature fusion strategy to combine relevant information and to improve the features' discrimination capacity. Finally, the support vector machine (SVM) is used to construct the final representation of facial features. Experimental results show that our proposed framework achieves a state-of-the-art performance without finetuning, data augmentation or coding strategy on benchmark databases, namely the MSU mobile face spoof database and the CASIA face anti-spoofing database. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Identity authentication based on face recognition has been significantly improved due to the outstanding ability of face detection, thus it plays an important role in society. However, face recognition system might be deceived by malicious face spoof attacks raising risk from both safety and property. The algorithm to accurately detect face anti-spoofing in identity authentication system is becoming crucial. In this paper, a shallow convolutional neural network with laplacian embedding (shallowCNN-LE) is proposed for face anti-spoofing. Two different types of features are concatenated to accurately detect the face liveness, including depth features and dynamic texture features. First, the developed shallow CNN model contains four layers which make the model faster. Second, we integrate dynamic texture features extracted by using the dual tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) with the depth features as input features to feed into the proposed model. Finally, we propose a laplacian embedding algorithm, which can maintain the inter-class discrimination and penalize the distance of intra-class. When embedding the laplacian loss with the softmax loss, the proposed method can obtain much more discriminative features, which is helpful to detect face anti-spoofing. Experimental results on public databases of CASIA FASD, Replay attack and MSU USSA database demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for face anti-spoofing detection. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Biometrics systems have replaced traditional ways of authenticating systems. The concept of face recognition based on the fact that every person has different biological attributes. Yet, these systems have a possibility to suffer from the various types of spoofing attacks. Spoofing is the process of fooling the system by impersonating a legitimate user to gain illegal access. Face verification systems are the easiest ones to suffer from spoof attack because facial pictures are easy to access. Spoofing attack can be classified into two types: 2D and 3D. 2D attacks faked by using the photos or video of the legitimate user and 3D attacks faked by using 3D masks. Here, We have introduced a new approach to detect presence of 3D mask based face anti-spoofing using frequency and texture based feature descriptors. The proposed approach extracts Local Binary Pattern based texture features from discrete wavelet transformed images. We have evaluated the proposed approach on the 3D Mask Attack dataset that is available publicly. Our approach is performed better than state of art. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Spoofing denotes attempts to cheat biometric technologies with artefacts (e.g. fake fingers, masks). This way of circumventing biometric systems has recently generated great interest in the line of work known as ‘anti-spoofing’, which is responsible for developing counter measures. Part of the work of biometric laboratories revolves around identifying imaginable spoofs and spoofers and developing technologies that can detect real from fake bodies. Based on fieldwork among researchers in a biometric lab and at at international conferences where policy-makers, security officials and industry discuss biometric technologies, the article shows how the figure of the spoofer epitomizes certain concerns and brings with it particular types of practices and threat scenarios. Biometric technologies, it is argued, are constantly changing shape in response to the imagined, potential threats embodied by the spoofer in, for example, state security contexts and at borders, where fears of the potential consequences of uncontrolled migration, terrorism and global crime prevail. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - With the development of face recognition system towards automation and unsupervised, illegal intruders have become a serious threat to face authentication system by disguising face authentication system, how to ensure the security of the face recognition system has become an urgent problem in face recognition technology. Therefore, living face detection has become an important issue that must be solved in the face authentication system. By deeply studying the importance of facial image color feature information for human face detection, a deep feature fusion network structure is constructed by deep convolutional neural networks ResNet and SENet to effectively train the involved face anti-spoof data. The feature with large amount of information, while suppressing the features with low usefulness, the experimental results are greatly improved compared with the traditional methods, and have higher recognition effect and accuracy. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.

AB  - With the wide deployment of the face recognition system, many face attacks, such as print attack, video attack and 3D face mask, have emerged. Face anti-spoofing is very important to protect face recognition system from attack. This paper proposes a structure of generative adversarial networks with skip connection for face anti-spoofing. First, we obtain the latent spatial features of faces by training generative adversarial networks to reconstruct both real and spoof faces; second, we use the convolution neural networks to detect the spoofing faces. In this paper, the proposed method is evaluated by three public databases. The results suggest that our approach achieves as high as 98% accuracy on both CASIA-FASD and REPLAY-ATTACK databases. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Face recognition. A promise made to the modern technologists as the ultimate access control or surveillance technology. However, it is still vulnerable to inexpensive spoofing attacks, which pose a threat to security. Basic face spoofing attacks that use photographs and video are still not addressed appropriately, especially in real-time applications, thereby making security in these environments a difficult task to achieve. Although methods have improved over the last decade, a robust solution that can accommodate changing environments is still out of reach. Face spoofing attacks introduce an object into the scene, which presents curvilinear singularities that are not necessarily portrayed in the same way in different lighting conditions. We present a solution that addresses this problem by using a discrete shearlet transform as an alternative descriptor that can differentiate between a real and a fake face without user-cooperation. We have found the approach can successfully detect blurred edges, texture changes and other noise found in various face spoof attacks. Our benchmarks on the publicly available CASIA-FASD, MSU-MFSD, and OULU-NPU data sets, show that our approach portrays good results and improves on the most popular methods found in the field on modest computer hardware, but requires further improvement to beat the current state of the art. The approach also achieves real-time face spoof discrimination, which makes it a practical solution in real-time applications and a viable augmentation to current face recognition methods. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Face spoofing countermeasure is vital to avoid an imposter from gaining access to security biometric systems by using face masks in various forms that mimic a valid user face. Recently, several studies have shown the ability of visible polarized light in distinguishing real and fake faces. In this paper, polarization imaging systems using visible and near infrared (NIR) are proposed to examine the effects on the polarization images as trial to distinguish between genuine face and spoof face presentation attacks: photo paper and iPad face display; based on the optical properties of the materials. The findings from the investigations suggest that in general, NIR light could not be used to distinguish between genuine face and photo paper under a polarization lighting condition. In contrast, the visible light provides significant difference of the Stokes images between the materials. Classification between real face and iPad display can easily be done by manipulating the polarization angle. A new feature fusion formula named as the SDOLP3F is introduced to differentiate between the real and the fake traits. The SDOLP3F results presented in this paper show the highest accuracy rate compared to the individual measures. The results illustrate the robustness of the proposed anti-spoofing algorithm based on a small sample. © 2019 Azim Zaliha Abd Aziz.

AB  - In this article we describe the implementation of a reliable and innovative ensemble-based technique that can prevent face spoofing attacks. The presented software is part of a technology developed in partnership with IsItYou, an Israeli company, that attempts to replace passwords with a face-based authentication system. Since the main problem of biometric systems is represented by the spoof attacks, IsItYou came with a solution to this, developing a unique technology that can identify spoof attacks, and authenticate only authorized humans. Inspired from deep learning techniques where ensemble-based solutions improve machine learning results by uniting several models, a software ensemble that combines multiple anti-spoofing methods, covering a larger range of spoof attacks and increasing overall security was developed. The article also shows the performances results and implementation details. The experimental results signpost our solution can provide first-rate results compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. © 2012-2019.

AB  - Currently, face recognition is widely used in many applications including access and security systems. However, a malicious user can spoof such systems by using a photo or recorded video of a legitimate user to gain access. Therefore, it is essential to solve this problem using anti-spoofing measures that can determine whether the face image presented to the system is genuine or a spoof. In this paper, we proposed a novel anti-spoofing system based on local texture features. The local features of the input image are extracted using Quaternionic Local Ranking Binary Pattern (QLRBP). We evaluate the effectiveness of these features using two different classifiers, namely the K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM). Our experiments using publicly available datasets show that our proposed system could achieve up to 95.20% accuracy (at 205.62 ms per frame) using the KNN classifier. Using the SVM, our proposed system can achieve up to 97.36% accuracy at 229.39 ms per frame. These results show that the QLRBP features are suitable to be used in a face anti-spoofing applications. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Using 2D images in authentication systems raises the question of spoof attacks: is it possible to deceive an authentication system using fake models possessing identical visual properties of the genuine one? In this work, an anti-spoofing method approach for a wine anti-counterfeiting system is presented. The proposed method relies in two different color spaces: CIE L*u*v* and, to distinguish between a genuine instance and a spoof attack. To evaluate the proposed strategy, two databases were used: a private database, with photos/2D attacks of cork stoppers, created for this work; and the public Replay-Attack database that is used for face spoofing detection methods testing. The results on the private database show that the anti-spoofing approach is able to distinguish with high accuracy a real photo from an attack. Regarding the public database, the results were obtained with existing methods, as the best HTER results using a single frame approach. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Spoofing attacks provided by fake individuals are considered as a major interest on biometric systems. To implement a robust face biometric system, deploying a reliable anti-spoofing scheme is needed. The concentration of this study to organize the anti-spoofing technique is on overlapped face textures together with image quality assessment. Our proposed fake detection scheme applies double anti-spoofing solution to distinguish live and fake identities. Firstly, image quality assessment method is used to differentiate fake and real samples by comparing their quality. The fake detection method using overlapped histograms of LBP texture descriptor is then applied for those samples recognized as real to increase the robustness of the biometric system against unreliable quality of images. Proposed spoof detection method presents an effective strategy for detecting fake face samples for video and print attacks. Demonstration of results on public spoof databases clarifies the robustness of the proposed solution for face fake detection. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB  - Face recognition system is exposed to video replay attacks and photo spoofing attacks along with the extensive use of identity authentication technology. Spoofing attack happens when an attacker tries to disguise as a legitimate user with permissions to spoof authentication system by replaying the recorded videos of legitimate users or utilizing the printed photos of legitimate users. Inspired by the differences between image acquisition and playback, printing properties, and light emission models, this paper proposes a live face detection method based on local binary pattern and Bandelet. The replayed video images and the printed face images usually contain characteristics that are easy to be detected by texture detection and frequency domain analysis. The proposed method analyzes the differences between live faces and photo faces in texture, at the same time it utilizes Bandelet to analyze face images with multi-scale analysis and extracts the high-frequency sub band coefficients as feature vectors to train Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) to classify and recognize. The algorithm is verified on the public CASIA-FASD, print-attack and replay-attack datasets, well known Face Anti-Spoofing Databases, and the experimental results show that the method reduces the computational complexity and improves the detection accuracy.

AB  - The use of image based presentation attack detection (PAD) systems has experienced an enormous growth of interest in recent years. The most accurate techniques in literature addressing this topic rely on the verification of the actual three-dimensionality of the face, which increases complexity and costs of the system. In this work, we propose an effective and low-cost face spoofing detector system to supplement a PPGI-based vital signal monitoring application. Starting from a set of automatically located facial feature points, the movement information of this set of points was obtained. Based on a time series analysis of the landmark position distances using peak descriptors and cross-correlation coefficients as classifiers in a sliding window, life signs have been exploited to develop a system being able to recognize false detections and biometric spoofs. To verify the performance, experiments on three different benchmark datasets (CASIA face anti-spoofing, MSU and IDIAP Replay-Attack databases) were made. The evaluation of the proposed low-cost approach showed good results (accuracy of ~85-95%) compared to more resource-intensive state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - Imposters gain unauthorized access to biometric recognition systems using fake biometric data of the legitimate user termed as spoofing. Spoofing of face recognition systems is done by photographs, 3D models and videos of the user. Attack video contains noise from the acquisition process. In this work, we use noise residual content of the video in order to detect spoofed videos. We take advantage of wavelet transform for representing the noise video. Samples of the noise video, termed as visual rhythm image is created for each video. Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and uniform Local Binary Pattern (LBPu2) are extracted from the visual rhythm image followed by classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM). Large size of video from which a number of frames are used for analysis results in huge execution timing. In this work the spoof detection algorithm is applied on various levels of subsections of the video frames resulting in reduced execution timing with reasonable detection accuracies.

AB  - Automated detection of sensor level spoof attacks is critical for success of surveillance technologies and the detection of crimes. This paper presents a new approach to more accurately detect such spoof face presentation attempts during the surveillance. The image data from the spoof samples not only illustrates the subtle texture difference in the spatial domain but is also accompanied by temporal differences as compared to those from the live/real human samples. Therefore, we investigate a new approach to encode the sparsity of these two different categories while combining these two cues from the acquired image sequences. The spatial and temporal information in the acquired image data and the sparse dictionary approach are used to encode such information in effectively separating the spoof and the live categories. This approach does not require large number of training samples, such as for the deep learning based methods, while achieving very good performance. The experimental results presented in this paper on publicly available database achieve outperforming results and illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2016 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

AB  - Due to its several advantages including practicality and simple requirements, facial identification has attracted a great amount of attention over the past years. Nonetheless, several studies have investigated the vulnerabilities a face biometrics system might face. Therefore, many researches are investigating the countermeasures to these spoof attempts. Unlike passive authentication methods that were profoundly studied, interaction was broadly examined as a potential robust spoofing prevention approach. In this paper, we present our collected dataset, propose an interactive authentication method, evaluate and compare its robustness to the best known static anti-spoofing detection approach under realistic conditions. © (2014) by Society of Digital Information and Wireless Communication (SDIWC).
