AB User verification systems that use a single biometric indicator often have to contend with noisy sensor data, restricted degrees of freedom, non-universality of the biometric trait and unacceptable error rates. Attempting to improve the performance of individual matchers in such situations may not prove to be effective because of these inherent problems. Multibiometric systems seek to alleviate some of these drawbacks by providing multiple evidences of the same identity. These systems help achieve an increase in performance that may not be possible using a single biometric indicator. Further, multibiometric systems provide anti-spoofing measures by making it difficult for an intruder to spoof multiple biometric traits simultaneously. However, an effective fusion scheme is necessary to combine the information presented by multiple domain experts. This paper addresses the problem of information fusion in biometric verification systems by combining information at the matching score level. Experimental results on combining three biometric modalities (face, fingerprint and hand geometry) are presented. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Eye blink detection is useful in many applications, such as human-computer interface, driver awareness detection, and so on. Here we consider eye blink as an evidence of liveness to exclude using some fakes, mainly 2D photographs, to spoof face recognition systems. The detection of eye blink is done by signal analysis of multi-scale and multi-orientation Gabor responses of eye images. First, based on Gabor decomposition, we derive multiple Gabor response waves (GRW) and show some of them are homo-responsive to the behavior of eye blink. Second, probable blinking signals contained in GRWs are segmented out and reshaped into pulses. Third, the ratio of the union to the intersection (RUI) of the reshaped pulses is proposed as the indicator of the extent of eye blink. Our method has successfully detected eye blink under various conditions and can be applied to liveness detection in video-based face recognition system. © 2008 IEEE.

AB Face and fingerprint are, currently, the most thoroughly explored biometric traits, promising reliable recognition in diverse applications. Commercial products using these traits for biometric identification or authentication are increasingly widespread, from smartphones to border control. However, increasingly smart techniques to counterfeit such traits raise the need for traits that are less vulnerable to stealthy trait measurement or spoofing attacks. This has sparked interest on the electrocardiogram (ECG), most commonly associated with medical diagnosis, whose hidden nature and inherent liveness information make it highly resistant to attacks. In the last years, the topic of ECG-based biometrics has quickly evolved toward the commercial applications, mainly by addressing the reduced acceptability and comfort by proposing new off-the-person, wearable, and seamless acquisition settings. Furthermore, researchers have recently started to address the issues of spoofing prevention and data security in ECG biometrics, as well as the potential of deep learning methodologies to enhance the recognition accuracy and robustness. In this paper, we conduct a deep review and discussion of 93 state-of-the-art publications on their proposed methods, signal datasets, and publicly available ECG collections. The extracted knowledge is used to present the fundamentals and the evolution of ECG biometrics, describe the current state of the art, and draw conclusions on prior art approaches and current challenges. With this paper, we aim to delve into the current opportunities as well as inspire and guide future research in ECG biometrics. © 2013 IEEE.

AB The recent literature on face recognition technology discusses the issue of face spoofing which can bypass the authentication system by placing a photo/video/mask of the enrolled person in front of the camera. This problem could be minimized by detecting the liveness of the person. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a robust liveness detection scheme based on challenge and response method. The liveness module is added as extra layer of security before the face recognition module. The liveness module utilizes face macro features, especially eye and mouth movements in order to generate random challenges and observing the user's response on account of this. The reliability of liveness module is tested by placing different types of spoofing attacks with various means, like using photograph, videos, etc. In all, five types of attacks have been taken care of and prevented by our system. Experimental results show that system is able to detect the liveness when subjected to all these attacks except the eye & mouth imposter attack. This attack is able to bypass the liveness test but it creates massive changes in face structure. Therefore resultant unrecognized or misclassified by the face recognition module. An experimental test conducted on 65 persons on university of Essex face database confirms that removal of eye and nose components results 75% misclassification. © 2014 IEEE.

AB Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder associated with a deficiency in C1 inhibitor. More than 200 mutations in this gene, located on chromosome 11, have been identified. Although HAE is often inherited, 20-25% of cases are from new spontaneous mutations and they have no family history of swelling. Decreased C1 inhibitor activity leads to inappropriate activation of multiple pathways, including the complement and contact systems and the fibrinolysis and coagulation systems. Reduced C1 inhibitor activity results in increased activation of plasma kallikrein-kinin system proteases and increased bradykinin levels. Bradykinin is felt to be the main mediator of symptoms in HAE. Patients with HAE have recurrent episodes of swelling of the extremities, abdomen, face, and upper airway. Angioedema involving the gastrointestinal tract can lead to intestinal wall edema, which results in abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Laryngeal swelling is life-threatening and may lead to asphyxia. Common triggers of an attack include trauma, stress, infection, menstruation, oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Laboratory testing including C4, C1 inhibitor level, and function is needed to confirm or rule out the diagnosis of HAE. The treatment of HAE has improved significantly in recent years with the availability of several safe and effective therapies. Several consensus guidelines have been created to further assist in the management of HAE patients. This review will provide an update on the classification, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of HAE. Copyright © 2011, OceanSide Publications, Inc.

AB A system that combines real-time face tracking as well as the localization of facial landmarks in order to improve the authenticity of fingerprint recognition is introduced. The intended purpose of this application is to assist in securing public areas and individuals, in addition to enforce that the collected sensor data in a multi modal person authentication system originate from present persons, i.e. the system is not under a so called play back attack. Facial features are extracted with the help of Gabor filters and classified by SVM experts. For real-time performance, selected points from a retinotopic grid are used to form regional face models. Additionally only a subset of the Gabor decomposition is used for different face regions. The second modality presented is texture-based fingerprint recognition, exploiting linear symmetry. Experimental results on the proposed system are presented.

AB Background Headaches occur commonly in all patients, including those who have brain tumors. It has been argued that there is a classic "brain tumor headache type" - defined by the International Headache Society as one that is localized, progressive, worse in the morning, aggravated by coughing or bending forward, develops in temporal and often spatial relation to the neoplasm, and resolves within 7 days of surgical removal or treatment with corticosteroids. Methods Using the search terms "headache and brain tumors," "intracranial neoplasms and headache," and "facial pain and brain tumors," we reviewed the literature from the past 20 years on brain tumor-associated headache and reflected upon the International Classification of Headache Disorders-3 (ICHD-3). In a separate, complementary paper, the proposed mechanisms of brain tumor headache are reviewed. Results We discuss multiple clinical presentations of brain tumor headaches, present the ICHD-3 diagnostic criteria for each type of headache, and then apply our findings to the ICHD-3. Our primary and major finding was that brain tumor headaches can present similarly to primary headaches in those with a predisposition to headaches, suggesting that following ICHD-3 criteria could cause a clinician to overlook a headache caused by a brain tumor. We further find that some types of headaches are not explicitly discussed in the ICHD-3 and also propose that the International Headache Society formally define SMART (Stroke-like Migraine Attacks after Radiation Therapy) syndrome given the increasing amount of literature on this disorder. Conclusion Our literature review revealed that brain tumor headache uncommonly presents with classic brain tumor headache characteristics and often satisfies criteria for a primary headache category such as migraine or tension-type. Thus, clinicians may miss headaches due to brain tumors in following ICHD-3 criteria, and the distinction between primary and secondary headache disorders may not be so clear-cut. © 2014 American Headache Society.

AB In this paper we propose a novel fusion protocol based on fuzzy fusion of face and voice features for checking liveness in secure identity authentication systems based on face and voice biometrics. Liveness checking can detect fraudulent impostor attacks on the security systems, and ensure that biometric cues are acquired from a live person who is actually present at the time of capture for authenticating the identity. The proposed fuzzy fusion of audio visual features is based on mutual dependency models which extract the spatio-temporal correlation between face and voice dynamics during speech production, Performance evaluation in terms of DET (Detector Error Tradeoff) curves and EERs (Equal Error Rates) on publicly available audiovisual speech databases show a significant improvement in performance of proposed fuzzy fusion of face-voice features based on mutual dependency models over conventional fusion techniques. © 2010 IEEE.

AB We present a logic-based framework to evaluate the resilience of computer networks in the face of incidents, i.e., attacks from malicious intruders as well as random faults. Our model uses a two-layered presentation of dependencies between files and services, and of timed games to represent not just incidents, but also the dynamic responses from administrators and their respective delays. We demonstrate that a variant TATL◇ of timed alternating-time temporal logic is a convenient language to express several desirable properties of networks, including several forms of survivability. We illustrate this on a simple redundant Web service architecture, and show that checking such timed games against the so-called TATL◇ variant of the timed alternating time temporal logic TATL is EXPTIME-complete. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

AB Performance of face liveness detection algorithms in cross-database face liveness detection tests is one of the key issues in face-biometric based systems. Recently, Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) classifiers have shown remarkable performance in intra-database face liveness detection tests. However, a little effort has been made to improve the generalization capability of CNN classifiers for cross-database and unconstrained face liveness detection tests. In this paper, we propose an efficient strategy for training deep CNN classifiers for face liveness detection task. We utilize continuous data-randomization (like bootstrapping) in the form of small mini-batches during training CNN classifiers on small scale face anti-spoofing database. Experimental results revealed that the proposed approach reduces the training time by 18.39%, while significantly lowering the HTER by 8.28% and 14.14% in cross-database tests on CASIA-FASD and Replay-Attack database respectively as compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Additionally, the proposed approach achieves satisfactory results on intra-database and cross-database face liveness detection tests, claiming a good generality over other state-of-the-art face anti-spoofing approaches. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB The paper faces the reachability and the reversibility problems in a class of Petri nets larger than other classes investigated for the same problems. The considered class of Petri net represents a formal language to design and analyze logic controllers. These nets may be decomposed in simple structures, called elementary control tasks, linked together through a limited number of connections, giving rise to arbitrarily complex nets. Such connections are the ones encountered in a typical logic control problem, as exchange of enabling signals (consensus/deny to control maneuvers) and the synchronous execution (shared resources modeling or shared operations). The purpose of the paper is to enlarge the set of theoretical tools previously developed for the incremental approach to the liveness analysis of a net, to be incorporated into a special CAD environment. In particular, the addressed topics are the choice of the initial marking and the analysis of reachability of non live markings. © 1994 IEEE

AB Research on non-intrusive software-based face spoofing detection schemes has been mainly focused on the analysis of the luminance information of the face images, hence discarding the chroma component, which can be very useful for discriminating fake faces from genuine ones. This paper introduces a novel and appealing approach for detecting face spoofing using a colour texture analysis. We exploit the joint colour-texture information from the luminance and the chrominance channels by extracting complementary low-level feature descriptions from different colour spaces. More specifically, the feature histograms are computed over each image band separately. Extensive experiments on the three most challenging benchmark data sets, namely, the CASIA face anti-spoofing database, the replay-attack database, and the MSU mobile face spoof database, showed excellent results compared with the state of the art. More importantly, unlike most of the methods proposed in the literature, our proposed approach is able to achieve stable performance across all the three benchmark data sets. The promising results of our cross-database evaluation suggest that the facial colour texture representation is more stable in unknown conditions compared with its gray-scale counterparts. © 2016 IEEE.

AB This paper presents a liveness detection method based on tracking the gaze of the user of a face recognition system using a single camera. The user is required to follow a visual animation of a moving object on a display screen while his/her gaze is measured. The visual stimulus is designed to direct the gaze of the user to sets of collinear points on the screen. Features based on the measured collinearity of the observed gaze are then used to discriminate between live attempts at responding to this challenge and those conducted by "impostors" holding photographs and attempting to follow the stimulus. An initial set of experiments is reported that indicates the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting this class of spoofing attacks. © 2012 IEEE.

AB Although face recognition systems have wide application, they are vulnerable to presentation attack samples (fake samples). Therefore, a presentation attack detection (PAD) method is required to enhance the security level of face recognition systems. Most of the previously proposed PAD methods for face recognition systems have focused on using handcrafted image features, which are designed by expert knowledge of designers, such as Gabor filter, local binary pattern (LBP), local ternary pattern (LTP), and histogram of oriented gradients (HOG). As a result, the extracted features reflect limited aspects of the problem, yielding a detection accuracy that is low and varies with the characteristics of presentation attack face images. The deep learning method has been developed in the computer vision research community, which is proven to be suitable for automatically training a feature extractor that can be used to enhance the ability of handcrafted features. To overcome the limitations of previously proposed PAD methods, we propose a new PAD method that uses a combination of deep and handcrafted features extracted from the images by visible-light camera sensor. Our proposed method uses the convolutional neural network (CNN) method to extract deep image features and the multi-level local binary pattern (MLBP) method to extract skin detail features from face images to discriminate the real and presentation attack face images. By combining the two types of image features, we form a new type of image features, called hybrid features, which has stronger discrimination ability than single image features. Finally, we use the support vector machine (SVM) method to classify the image features into real or presentation attack class. Our experimental results indicate that our proposed method outperforms previous PAD methods by yielding the smallest error rates on the same image databases. © 2018 by the authors.

AB Background The B2 receptor antagonist icatibant is approved for treatment of attacks of hereditary angioedema. Icatibant has been reported to decrease time-to-resolution of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-associated angioedema in 1 study of European patients. Objective We sought to test the hypothesis that a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist would shorten time-to-resolution from ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema. Methods Patients with ACE inhibitor–associated angioedema (defined as swelling of lips, tongue, pharynx, or face during ACE inhibitor use and no swelling in the absence of ACE inhibitor use) were enrolled at Vanderbilt University Medical Center from October 2007 through September 2015 and at Massachusetts General Hospital in 2012. C1 inhibitor deficiency and patients with bowel edema only were excluded. Patients were randomized within 6 hours of presentation to subcutaneous icatibant 30 mg or placebo at 0 and 6 hours later. Patients assessed severity of swelling using a visual analog scale serially following study drug administration or until discharge. Results Thirty-three patients were randomized and 31 received treatment, with 13 receiving icatibant and 18 receiving placebo. One patient randomized to icatibant did not complete the visual analog scale and was excluded from analyses. Two-thirds of patients were black and two-thirds were women. Time-to-resolution of symptoms was similar in placebo and icatibant treatment groups (P =.19 for the primary symptom and P &gt;.16 for individual symptoms of face, lip, tongue, or eyelid swelling). Frequency of administration of H1 and H2 blockers, corticosteroids, and epinephrine was similar in the 2 treatment groups. Time-to-resolution of symptoms was similar in black and white patients. Conclusions This study does not support clinical efficacy of a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist in ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema. © 2016 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology

AB Presentation attacks (a.k.a, direct attacks or spoofing attacks) against face recognition systems have emerged as a serious security threat. To mitigate these attacks on conventional face recognition systems, several Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) algorithms have been developed, which address various Presentation Attack Instruments (PAI) including 3D face masks, 2D photo, wrap photo and electronic display, that can be used for the attack. In this paper, we demonstrate and evaluate the vulnerability of an extended Multispectral face recognition system. The extended Multispectral system captures the face image across various spectral bands, thus, we propose to study each of these spectral bands for the vulnerability towards presentation attacks. We have employed a commercial Multispectral camera-SpectraCam™ that can capture seven different spectral bands to collect both bona-fide (a.k.a, live or normal or real) samples as well as artefact (or spoof) face samples. Extensive experiments are carried out on the newly compiled database to provide insights on the vulnerability of the extended Multispectral face system towards PAI generated using a printer. We have created the face artefacts using two different printers, which include laser and inkjet printers. Further, we have also evaluated the state-of-the-art PAD algorithms that are widely employed in conventional face PAD systems. Our study reveals the vulnerability of extended Multispectral face recognition system with respect to the print attack. The results obtained using state-of-the-art PAD algorithms further indicate the challenge to detect the presentation attacks in extended Multispectral face recognition systems. © 2017 IEEE.

AB Biometric systems are vulnerable to the diverse attacks that emerged as a challenge to assure the reliability in adopting these systems in real-life scenario. In this work, we propose a novel solution to detect a presentation attack based on exploring both statistical and Cepstral features. The proposed Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) algorithm will extract the statistical features that can capture the micro-texture variation using Binarized Statistical Image Features (BSIF) and Cepstral features that can reflect the micro changes in frequency using 2D Cepstrum analysis. We then fuse these features to form a single feature vector before making a decision on whether a capture attempt is a normal presentation or an artefact presentation using linear Support Vector Machine (SVM). Extensive experiments carried out on a publicly available face and iris spoof database show the efficacy of the proposed PAD algorithm with an Average Classification Error Rate (ACER) = 10.21% on face and ACER = 0% on the iris biometrics. © 2014 EURASIP.

AB Face liveness detection in visible light (VIS) spectrum is facing great challenges. Beyond visible light spectrum, thermal IR (TIR) has intrinsic live signal itself. In this paper, we present a novel liveness detection approach based on thermal IR spectrum. Live face is modeled in the cross-modality of thermal IR and visible light spectrum. In our model, canonical correlation analysis between visible and thermal IR face is exploited. The correlation of different face parts is also investigated to illustrate more correlative features and be helpful to improve live face detection ability. An extensive set of liveness detection experiments are presented to show effectiveness of our approach and other correlation methods are also tested for comparison. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB Violence and conflict appear to be increasingly common aspects of everyday life, to the point where people take them into consideration when planning their activities and feel anxious about their possible occurrence. It is not only actual violence which offers a contemporary source of stress but also the threat of violence, although subjective estimates of risk are not always accurate. For example, it would appear that while the elderly feel the most threatened, the greatest risk is to those in their late teens and early twenties. This discrepancy between objective and subjective risk is understandable in terms of the different factors which have been shown to drive the subjective assessment of risk: availability of information, controllability and magnitude of outcome. Often it is the media which provides us with the information that we have on violence, and it is that presentation of information which helps shape our assessment of risk. For example, attacks by young persons on the elderly may be more dramatic and newsworthy than, albeit more frequent, attacks on other young persons. Thus they are reported to a greater extent and a distorted impression of risk begins to develop, which may be reinforced by realistic feelings of potential helplessness by the elderly in the face of any such attack, and fear of the magnitude of the consequences of violence. Whatever the real basis for a fear of violence, the available statistics in most European and North American countries suggests that, even taking into account the effects of reporting bias, acts of violence are increasing. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB In order to collect local data for children with Benign Childhood Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spikes (BECTS), we conducted a retrospective study of 50 Chinese children (32 males and 18 females) with BECTS diagnosed in two regional hospitals in Hong Kong from 1995 to 1998. Their peak age of onset was 7 years (range 3-13 years) and a male predominance was observed. Seven patients (14%) had a past history of febrile convulsions and five cases (10%) had a family history of epilepsy. The presentation was protean, but most of them had infrequent, short, nocturnal generalised seizures. The EEG spike foci were most frequently found in mid-temporal regions, followed by centrotemporal regions. Fourteen percent of children did not require anti-epileptic drug treatment. For those who were treated, they were easily controlled on a low dose of carbamazepine (median dosage of 12.75 mg/kg per day) or sodium valproate (median dosage of 20 mg/kg per day). Our study suggested a generally good prognosis for BECTS. No risk factors of frequent seizure recurrence could be identified. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Background. - Whereas the clinical features of pure triptan overuse headache (TOH) are well known, there are insufficient data regarding the semiological pattern of headaches when triptan overuse is associated with other types of medication overuse. Objective. - To investigate and compare the clinical characteristics of patients with pure TOH and those with medication overuse headaches associating triptan and other medication overuses (combined TOH). Methods. - This cross-sectional, observational study was conducted in 7 tertiary-care headache centers participating in the French Observatory of Migraine and Headaches. From 2004 to 2006, data from 163 patients with TOH were collected in face-to-face structured interviews (according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd edition criteria). Results. - Eighty-two patients fulfilled criteria for pure TOH (pTOH patients) and 81 for combined TOH (cTOH) patients. Continuous headaches were reported in 76% of cTOH patients compared with 32% of pTOH patients. Significantly more frequent and severe headaches and more intense phono-/photophobia between attacks were noted in cTOH patients. More cTOH than pTOH patients reported a history of tension-type headaches and a long-standing history of chronic headaches. Finally, compared with pTOH patients, cTOH patients were characterized by stronger dependence on acute treatments of headaches according to the DSM-IV criteria. Conclusions. - Combined therapy with analgesics and/or the total number of drug units taken per day may cause a shift from a pattern of clear-cut headache attacks in patients with pTOH toward more severe clinical presentation in patients with cTOH. These patients should receive more intensive prophylactic therapy and specific behavioral management. © 2009 American Headache Society.

AB The concern of the safety of fingerprint authentication system is rising with its widely using for it is easy to be attacked by spoof (fake) fingerprints. Fake fingerprints are usually made of Ploy-Doh, silicon or other artifacts. So most current approaches rely on fingerprint liveness detection as main anti-spoofing mechanisms. Recently, researchers propose to use local feature descriptor for fingerprint liveness detection, but the results are still not satisfying the real world application requirement. Inspired by the newly trend of application of Deep Convolution Neural Network (DCNN) in computer vision field and its outstanding performance in face detection and image classification, we propose a novel fingerprint liveness detection method based on DCNN and voting strategy, which performs better than handcraft feature and optimize the process of feature extraction and classifier training simultaneously. The experimental results on the datasets of LivDet2011 and LivDet2013 show that the proposed algorithm has great improvement compare to the former state-of-the-art algorithm, and keep highly real-time performance at the same time. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB The problem of detecting face spoofing attacks (presentation attacks) has recently gained a well-deserved popularity. Mainly focusing on 2D attacks forged by displaying printed photos or replaying recorded videos on mobile devices, a significant portion of these studies ground their arguments on the flatness of the spoofing material in front of the sensor. In this paper, we inspect the spoofing potential of subject-specific 3D facial masks for 2D face recognition. Additionally, we analyze Local Binary Patterns based coun-termeasures using both color and depth data, obtained by Kinect. For this purpose, we introduce the 3D Mask Attack Database (3DMAD), the first publicly available 3D spoofing database, recorded with a low-cost depth camera. Extensive experiments on 3DMAD show that easily attainable facial masks can pose a serious threat to 2D face recognition systems and LBP is a powerful weapon to eliminate it. © 2013 IEEE.

AB Biometric authentication is now being used ubiquitously as an alternative to passwords on mobile devices. However, current biometric systems are vulnerable to simple spoofing attacks. Several liveness detection methods have been proposed to determine whether there is a live person or an artificial replica in front of the biometric sensor. Yet, the problem is unsolved due to hardship in finding discriminative and computationally inexpensive features for spoofing attacks. Moreover, previous liveness detection approaches are not explicitly aimed for mobile biometric, thus principally unsuited for portable devices. Therefore, we build a software-based multi-biometric prototype that detects face, iris and fingerprint spoofing attacks on mobile devices. We present MoBio-LivDet (Mobile Biometric Liveness Detection), a novel approach that analyzes local features and global structures of the biometric images using a set of low-level feature descriptors and decision level fusion. The system allows user to balance the security level (robustness against spoofing) and convenience that they want. The proposed method is highly fast, simple, efficient, robust and does not require user-cooperation, thus making it extremely apt for mobile devices. Experimental analysis on publicly available face, iris and fingerprint data sets with real spoofing attacks show promising results. © 2014 IEEE.

AB OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival injection and tearing syndrome is a very rare disorder characterized by short-lasting neuralgiform unilateral pain affecting the orbital-periorbital area and associated with autonomic phenomena consisting mainly of conjunctival injection, tearing, and rhinorrhea. Treatment of this condition is difficult; many drugs and surgical procedures have been tried with variable results. In the literature, two cases have been described with short-term response to microvascular decompression of the trigeminal root. We present the case of a patient with short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival injection and tearing syndrome who remains asymptomatic 2 years after microvascular decompression. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old woman was referred to our clinic because she had experienced pain in the distribution of the first left trigeminal branch during the previous 2 years. She experienced paroxysms lasting from a few seconds to 1 to 2 minutes superimposed over a dull sensation of pain involving the same territory. The paroxysms had no refractory period and were triggered by touching the eye or the left side of the face, chewing, yawning, washing her hair, and even by light. Although the paroxysms were triggered by light touch or chewing, she was able to talk or touch herself while having the paroxysm. During pain attacks, she experienced tearing and ipsilateral conjunctival injection, eyelid edema and rhinorrhea, as well as intense photophobia. A magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed a vascular structure distorting and compressing the trigeminal root. INTERVENTION: The patient underwent microvascular decompression of the trigeminal root. At surgery, there was clear compression of the trigeminal root by a superior cerebellar artery loop that was resolved by interposing a Teflon patch. The patient awoke from the operation without pain, and all the accompanying signs and symptoms, such as photophobia, disappeared. The postoperative course was uneventful, and 2 years after treatment, the patient remains asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: Microvascular decompression could be an alternative therapeutic approach to this rare syndrome.

AB While face recognition systems got a significant boost in terms of recognition performance in recent years, they are known to be vulnerable to presentation attacks. Up to date, most of the research in the field of face anti-spoofing or presentation attack detection was considered as a two-class classification task: features of bona-fide samples versus features coming from spoofing attempts. The main focus has been on boosting the anti-spoofing performance for databases with identical types of attacks across both training and evaluation subsets. However, in realistic applications the types of attacks are likely to be unknown, potentially occupying a broad space in the feature domain. Therefore, a failure to generalize on unseen types of attacks is one of the main potential challenges in existing anti-spoofing approaches. First, to demonstrate the generalization issues of two-class anti-spoofing systems we establish new evaluation protocols for existing publicly available databases. Second, to unite the data collection efforts of various institutions we introduce a challenging Aggregated database composed of 3 publicly available datasets: Replay-Attack, Replay-Mobile and MSU MFSD, reporting the performance on it. Third, considering existing limitations we propose a number of systems approaching a task of presentation attack detection as an anomaly detection, or a one-class classification problem, using only bona-fide features in the training stage. Using less training data, hence requiring less effort in the data collection, the introduced approach demonstrates a better generalization properties against previously unseen types of attacks on the proposed Aggregated database. © 2018 IEEE.

AB Prior work has shown that multibiometric systems are vulnerable to presentation attacks, assuming that their matching score distribution is identical to that of genuine users, without fabricating any fake trait. We have recently shown that this assumption is not representative of current fingerprint and face presentation attacks, leading one to overestimate the vulnerability of multibiometric systems, and to design less effective fusion rules. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by proposing a statistical meta-model of face and fingerprint presentation attacks that characterizes a wider family of fake score distributions, including distributions of known and, potentially, unknown attacks. This allows us to perform a thorough security evaluation of multibiometric systems against presentation attacks, quantifying how their vulnerability may vary also under attacks that are different from those considered during design, through an uncertainty analysis. We empirically show that our approach can reliably predict the performance of multibiometric systems even under never-before-seen face and fingerprint presentation attacks, and that the secure fusion rules designed using our approach can exhibit an improved trade-off between the performance in the absence and in the presence of attack. We finally argue that our method can be extended to other biometrics besides faces and fingerprints. © 1979-2012 IEEE.

AB Background Most cervical dissections are treated with anticoagulation or antiplatelet agents with very good results; however, some patients may benefit from endovascular intervention. High cervical and skull base dissections are often more challenging to treat because of the distal location and tortuous anatomy. The Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) may be a reasonable treatment option for this indication. Objectives To report a case series of patients treated with the PED for high cervical and skull base dissections, focusing on their presentation, indications for treatment, dissection revascularization success, and pseudoaneurysm obliteration evaluated by imaging, and to review available pertinent literature. Methods We retrospectively reviewed all cases of high cervical and skull base dissections treated with a PED at our institution. Patient clinical characteristics, presentation, procedural and follow-up imaging, and clinical course were analyzed to evaluate for procedure complications, dissection revascularization success, pseudoaneurysm obliteration, and clinical outcome. Results This is a retrospective case series including 11 patients with 13 carotid dissections treated in our center. There were nine traumatic and four spontaneous dissections. The most common presentation was cerebrovascular accident/transient ischemic attack (CVA/TIA; 5 patients) and headache/face pain (4 patients). Eleven dissections were associated with pseudoaneurysms. Three patients failed medical management with anticoagulation, although flow-limiting stenosis was the main indication for endovascular intervention. Up to three PEDs per vessel were deployed. Angioplasty was used in 10 cases. Complete revascularization (< 10% residual stenosis) was achieved in 91% of vessels and 50% of pseudoaneurysms were completely or near completely obliterated immediately after PED(s) deployment. Proximal iatrogenic dissection was the only intraoperative complication. Follow-up imaging was available for nine treated vessels and demonstrated patent PEDs without significant in-stent stenosis up to 9months after intervention. 75% of pseudoaneurysms were completely obliterated at follow-up. One PED partially collapsed but had no neurological consequences. There were no new CVA/TIAs. Conclusions Our initial experience with treatment of high cervical and skull base dissections with the PED appears to show that this technique may be a safe and viable treatment option. However, long-term results are needed to fully evaluate the efficacy of such treatment. © 2016 Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

AB Leveraging built-in cameras on smartphones and tablets, face authentication provides an attractive alternative of legacy passwords due to its memory-less authentication process. However, it has an intrinsic vulnerability against the media-based facial forgery (MFF) where adversaries use photos/videos containing victims' faces to circumvent face authentication systems. In this paper, we propose FaceLive, a practical and robust liveness detection mechanism to strengthen the face authentication on mobile devices in fighting the MFF-based attacks. FaceLive detects the MFF-based attacks by measuring the consistency between device movement data from the inertial sensors and the head pose changes from the facial video captured by built-in camera. FaceLive is practical in the sense that it does not require any additional hardware but a generic frontfacing camera, an accelerometer, and a gyroscope, which are pervasively available on today's mobile devices. FaceLive is robust to complex lighting conditions, which may introduce illuminations and lead to low accuracy in detecting important facial landmarks; it is also robust to a range of cumulative errors in detecting head pose changes during face authentication. © 2015 ACM.

AB Cluster headache has been defined by the International Headache Society (IHS) as one of the primary headaches. A primary headache is a headache that has no other known cause, such as infection or trauma. Cluster headache is also listed as one of the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias. These headaches are mediated by the trigeminal nerve with accompanying autonomic symptoms that may range from conjunctival injection, lacrimation, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, forehead and facial sweating, miosis, and ptosis to eyelid edema. The IHS has described cluster headache as "attacks of severe, strictly unilateral pain that is orbital, supraorbital, temporal or in any combination of these sites, lasting 15 to 180 minutes." In the author's practice, as a dentist treating orofacial pain, patients with cluster headache have dental or midfacial complaints as a primary presentation. This paper introduces such presentations based on interviews with cluster headache patients, with the main purpose of having midfacial complaints considered as an important presentation to be added to the IHS diagnostic criteria for cluster headache.

AB Objective: To report our experience with high doses (0.1-0.2 mg per 10 kg pregnant weight) of intravenous (IV) nitroglycerin as a uterine relaxing agent for managing internal podalic version of the second twin in transverse lie with unruptured membranes. Methods: Between August 1994 and December 1997, we managed 22 cases of internal podalic version of the second twin with the administration of high doses of IV nitroglycerin. Results: Twenty internal podalic versions were completed successfully, and two cases failed. One failure was considered not related to IV nitroglycerin because the patient had a panic attack, requiring general anesthesia for sedation. The internal podalic version then succeeded. The patient with true failure of IV nitroglycerin required emergency cesarean because of acute fetal bradycardia and a nonrelaxed uterus. This was the only nontransverse lie, but with a very high face presentation. One internal podalic version was complicated by hemorrhage (2000 mL). Conclusion: Intravenous nitroglycerin to induce uterine atonia, with epidural analgesia, avoids general anesthesia and makes internal podalic version easier. In 22 cases (with success in 20) of internal podalic version of the second twin in transverse lie with unruptured membranes, IV nitroglycerin induced transient and prompt uterine relaxation without affecting maternal and fetal outcomes.

AB Vulnerability of face recognition systems to presentation attacks has attracted increasing attention from the biometrics and forensics communities. Moreover, the recent availability of light field cameras is opening new possibilities for designing improved face presentation attack detection solutions. In this context, this paper provides the first review and benchmarking study in the literature on light field-based face presentation attack detection solutions. State-of-the-art solutions are assessed in terms of accuracy, generalization and complexity, using a common, representative evaluation framework. This paper also proposes a novel face presentation attack detection solution, based on a histogram of oriented gradients descriptor, which exploits the disparity information available in light field imaging. The evaluation of the proposed face presentation attack detection solution for different presentation attack types shows a very effective and stable performance, notably performing better than the state-of-the-art alternatives. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB Face recognition systems are becoming ubiquitous, but they are vulnerable to spoofing attacks. The recently available light field cameras can be used for spoofing attack detection. In this study, the IST Lenslet Light Field Face Spoofing Database (IST LLFFSD) is proposed, consisting of 100 genuine images, from 50 subjects, captured with a Lytro ILLUM lenslet light field camera, and a set of 600 face spoofing attack images, captured using the same camera. The IST LLFFSD simulates six different types of presentation attacks, including printed paper, wrapped printed paper, laptop, tablet and two different mobile phones. This study also proposes a novel spoofing attack detection solution, based on a compact, yet effective, descriptor exploiting the colour and texture variations associated with the different directions of light captured in light field images. Extensive experiments show very effective results, with the proposed solution performing better than state-of-the-art alternatives for the face spoofing attack types considered. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017

AB For a robust face biometric system, a reliable anti-spoofing approach must be deployed to circumvent the print and replay attacks. Several techniques have been proposed to counter face spoofing, however a robust solution that is computationally efficient is still unavailable. This paper presents a new approach for spoofing detection in face videos using motion magnification. Eulerian motion magnification approach is used to enhance the facial expressions commonly exhibited by subjects in a captured video. Next, two types of feature extraction algorithms are proposed: (i) a configuration of LBP that provides improved performance compared to other computationally expensive texture based approaches and (ii) motion estimation approach using HOOF descriptor. On the Print Attack and Replay Attack spoofing datasets, the proposed framework improves the state-of-art performance, especially HOOF descriptor yielding a near perfect half total error rate of 0%and 1.25% respectively. © 2013 IEEE.

AB Face recognition systems are susceptible to presentation attacks such as printed photo attacks, replay attacks, and 3D mask attacks. These attacks, primarily studied in visible spectrum, aim to obfuscate or impersonate a person's identity. This paper presents a unique multispectral video face database for face presentation attack using latex and paper masks. The proposed Multispectral Latex Mask based Video Face Presentation Attack (MLFP) database contains 1350 videos in visible, near infrared, and thermal spectrums. Since the database consists of videos of subjects without any mask as well as wearing ten different masks, the effect of identity concealment is analyzed in each spectrum using face recognition algorithms. We also present the performance of existing presentation attack detection algorithms on the proposed MLFP database. It is observed that the thermal imaging spectrum is most effective in detecting face presentation attacks. © 2017 IEEE.

TI Face Spoof Attack Recognition Using Discriminative Image Patches

AB Face recognition systems are now being used in many applications such as border crossings, banks, and mobile payments. The wide scale deployment of facial recognition systems has attracted intensive attention to the reliability of face biometrics against spoof attacks, where a photo, a video, or a 3D mask of a genuine user's face can be used to gain illegitimate access to facilities or services. Though several face antispoofing or liveness detection methods (which determine at the time of capture whether a face is live or spoof) have been proposed, the issue is still unsolved due to difficulty in finding discriminative and computationally inexpensive features and methods for spoof attacks. In addition, existing techniques use whole face image or complete video for liveness detection. However, often certain face regions (video frames) are redundant or correspond to the clutter in the image (video), thus leading generally to low performances. Therefore, we propose seven novel methods to find discriminative image patches, which we define as regions that are salient, instrumental, and class-specific. Four well-known classifiers, namely, support vector machine (SVM), Naive-Bayes, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), and Ensemble, are then used to distinguish between genuine and spoof faces using a voting based scheme. Experimental analysis on two publicly available databases (Idiap REPLAY-ATTACK and CASIA-FASD) shows promising results compared to existing works. © 2016 Zahid Akhtar and Gian Luca Foresti.

AB The deployment of fingerprint sensors is increasingly becoming common and has now gained high user acceptance. However, fingerprint sensors are susceptible to spoofing using artificial materials or in worst case to the dismembered fingers. Fake/gummy fingerprints have shown to fool most commercial fingerprint systems. This paper proposes a new method of anti-spoofing using reliable liveness detection. The proposed method of liveness detection is based on pulse oximetry and involves the known source of light originating from a probe at two wavelengths. The light is partly absorbed by haemoglobin, by amounts which differ depending on whether it is saturated with oxygen or deoxygenated haemoglobin. We then perform the computations for the absorption at two wavelengths to estimate the proportion of haemoglobin which is oxygenated. The computed percentage of oxygen in the saturated blood, along with the heart pulse rate, determines the liveness of enrolled biometric. Our experimental results demonstrate that the developed prototype can successfully thwart the spoof attacks (including those based on dismembered fingers). ©2007 IEEE.

AB Fingerprints have been extensively used for biometric recognition around the world. However, fingerprints are not secrets, and an adversary can synthesis a fake finger to spoof the biometric system. The mainstream of the current fingerprint spoof detection methods are basically binary classifier trained on some real and fake samples. While they perform well on detecting fake samples created by using the same methods used for training, their performance degrades when encountering fake samples created by a novel spoofing method. In this paper, we approach the problem from a different perspective by incorporating electrocardiogram (ECG). Compared with the conventional biometrics, stealing someone's ECG is far more difficult if not impossible. Considering that ECG is a vital signal and motivated by its inherent liveness, we propose to combine it with a fingerprint liveness detection algorithm. The combination is natural as both ECG and fingerprints can be captured from fingertips. In the proposed framework, the ECG and fingerprint are combined not only for authentication purpose but also for liveness detection. We also examine automatic template updating using ECG and fingerprint. In addition, we propose a stopping criterion that reduces the average waiting time for signal acquisition. We have performed extensive experiments on the LivDet2015 database which is presently the latest available liveness detection database and compare the proposed method with six liveness detection methods as well as 12 participants of LivDet2015 competition. The proposed system has achieved a liveness detection equal error rate (EER) of 4.2% incorporating only 5 s of ECG. By extending the recording time to 30 s, liveness detection EER reduces to 2.6% which is about 4 times better than the best of six comparison methods. This is also about 2 times better than the best results achieved by the participants of the LivDet2015 competition. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB Face recognition technique has been widely applied to personal identification systems due to its satisfying performance. However, its security may be a crucial issue, since many studies have shown that face recognition systems may be vulnerable in an adversarial environment, in which an adversary can camouflage as a legitimate user in order to mislead the system. Although face liveness detection methods have been proposed to distinguish real and fake faces, they are either time-consuming, costly, or sensitive to noise and illumination. This paper proposes a face liveness detection method with flash against 2D spoofing attack. Flash not only can enhance the differentiation between legitimate and illegitimate users, but it also reduces the influence of environmental factors. Two images are taken from a subject, one with flash and another without flash. Four texture and 2D structure descriptors with low computational complexity are used to capture information of the two images in our model. Advantages of our method include low installation cost of flash and no user cooperation required. A data set of 50 subjects collected under different scenarios is used in the experiments to evaluate the proposed method. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model performs better than existing liveness detection methods in different environmental scenarios. This paper confirms that the use of flash successfully improves face liveness detection in terms of accuracy, robustness, and running time. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB Background and Purpose - Clinical identification of stroke in the pediatric emergency department is critical for improving access to hyperacute therapies. We identified key clinical features associated with childhood stroke or transient ischemic attack compared with mimics. Methods - Two hundred and eighty consecutive children presenting to the emergency department with mimics, prospectively recruited over 18 months from 2009 to 2010, were compared with 102 children with stroke or transient ischemic attack, prospectively/retrospectively recruited from 2003 to 2010. Results - Cerebrovascular diagnoses included arterial ischemic stroke (55), hemorrhagic stroke (37), and transient ischemic attack (10). Mimic diagnoses included migraine (84), seizures (46), Bell's palsy (29), and conversion disorders (18). Being well in the week before presentation (odds ratio [OR] 5.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.25-14.79), face weakness (OR 2.94, 95% CI 1.19-7.28), arm weakness (OR 8.66, 95% CI, 2.50-30.02), and inability to walk (OR 3.38, 95% CI 1.54-7.42) were independently associated with increased odds of stroke diagnosis. Other symptoms were independently associated with decreased odds of stroke diagnosis (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.10-0.77). Associations were not observed between seizures or loss of consciousness. Factors associated with stroke differed by arterial and hemorrhagic subtypes. Conclusions - Being well in the week before presentation, inability to walk, face and arm weakness are associated with increased odds of stroke. The lack of positive or negative association between stroke and seizures or loss of consciousness is an important difference to adults. Pediatric stroke pathways and bedside tools need to factor in differences between children and adults and between stroke subtypes. © 2016 The Authors.

TI Face liveness detection using dynamic local ternary pattern (DLTP)

DE Dynamic local ternary pattern; Face liveness detection; Skin texture analysis;
AB Face spoofing is considered to be one of the prominent threats to face recognition systems. However, in order to improve the security measures of such biometric systems against deliberate spoof attacks, liveness detection has received significant recent attention from researchers. For this purpose, analysis of facial skin texture properties becomes more popular because of its limited resource requirement and lower processing cost. The traditional method of skin analysis for liveness detection was to use Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and its variants. LBP descriptors are effective, but they may exhibit certain limitations in near uniform patterns. Thus, in this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Local Ternary Pattern (LTP) as an alternative to LBP. In addition, we adopted Dynamic Local Ternary Pattern (DLTP), which eliminates the manual threshold setting in LTP by using Weber’s law. The proposed method was tested rigorously on four facial spoof databases: three are public domain databases and the other is the Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) face spoof database, which was compiled through this study. The results obtained from the proposed DLTP texture descriptor attained optimum accuracy and clearly outperformed the reported LBP and LTP texture descriptors. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB Prey experience a broad range of temporal patterns of predation risk and may face different problems when assessing risk level and deciding how to allocate costly antipredator behaviour across time. We simulated in the laboratory repeated predatory attacks of different intensity (low versus high risk) to Iberian rock lizards, Iberolacerta cyreni, with similar numbers of low- and high-risk attacks across a trial, but with different temporal patterns of presentation (i.e. a series of low-risk and then a series of high risk, or vice versa, or successive attacks where risk changed randomly). We measured activity levels, time hidden in refuges after each predatory attack, and propensity to hide in refuges when the predator is close but not actually attacking ('false alarm' flights). Antipredator responses were of higher intensity when risk was high, but responses also depended on temporal patterns of risk. When previous attacks were of low-risk or when risk was random, prey activity did not change between risk levels. False alarm flights in the low-risk situation were more frequent when risk was random or immediately after a series of high-risk attacks. When successive attacks were of similar risk level, lizards seemed able to predict risk level in the next attack and modified their antipredator behaviour accurately. However, when risk level was random, lizards did not seem able to predict risk level and adopted a conservative strategy, overestimating risk even though costs of the antipredator responses increased. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Idiopathic inflammatory trigeminal sensory neuropathy (IITSN) is a disorder with the dominant clinical features of trigeminal sensory disturbance; this idiopathic condition follows a benign course in most cases. Recent reports have shown that transient abnormalities, which may mimic those of trigeminal neuromas, can be observed in magnetic resonance imaging scans. Presented here is a case of IITSN that was diagnosed, with cytological and histopathological verification, during the active inflammatory phase of the disease (the first such attempt, to our knowledge). CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 20-year-old female patient was referred to our hospital with a 2-month history of numbness of the left side of her face, headache, and hemifacial pain attacks. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed a mass above and below the foramen ovale, extending into the cavernous sinus. INTERVENTION: A percutaneous biopsy procedure through the foramen ovale was performed; the pathological examination revealed lymphocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells but no evidence of neoplastic cells. A few days later, the patient was surgically treated using a cranial base approach, the gasserian ganglion was exposed, and the lesion was removed. Pathological examination of the specimens revealed inflammatory changes and fibrosis of the nerve fibers and ganglion cells. Disruption of the myelin around the nerve bundles was detected. Therefore, IITSN was pathologically confirmed during the early stage of the disease. During 3 months of follow-up monitoring, the patient experienced no serious clinical problems. CONCLUSION: IITSN should be suspected in cases of tumors involving the cavernous sinus, and a percutaneous biopsy through the foramen ovale should be performed as part of the differential diagnosis in such cases. This procedure might obviate unnecessary aggressive surgery. In the current case, no neoplastic cells were observed during the examination; only lymphocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells were observed, on a background of erythrocytes. Lymphocyte-dominant inflammatory infiltration, fibrotic changes, and demyelinization are cardinal histopathological findings observed during the active phase of IITSN.

AB Face biometrics have attracted significant attention as a technology for secure access to mobile devices. This is because almost all smartphones have RGB cameras suitable for capturing faces, and the required user interaction is acceptable given the popularity of ‘selfies’. Most of the traditional methods for face biometrics may not be amenable to native execution on mobile hardware due to their limited memory and computing power. Consequently, a number of algorithms specifically designed or adapted to the mobile environment have been proposed for face biometrics. However, the state-of-the- art related to face biometrics in a mobile environment is not well known. This paper thoroughly and critically surveys face biometrics in terms of face detection and normalization, recognition, and anti-spoofing methods proposed for mobile devices. The overall aim is to improve understanding and discuss the advantages and limitations of the existing methods. Further, challenges and future research directions are identified for further research and development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB A robust face detection technique along with mouth localization, processing every frame in real time (video rate), is presented. Moreover, it is exploited for motion analysis onsite to verify "liveness" as well as to achieve lip reading of digits. A methodological novelty is the suggested quantized angle features ("quangles") being designed for illumination invariance without the need for preprocessing (e.g., histogram equalization). This is achieved by using both the gradient direction and the double angle direction (the structure tensor angle), and by ignoring the magnitude of the gradient. Boosting techniques are applied in a quantized feature space. A major benefit is reduced processing time (i.e., that the training of effective cascaded classifiers is feasible in very short time, less than 1 h for data sets of order 104). Scale invariance is implemented through the use of an image scale pyramid. We propose "liveness" verification barriers as applications for which a significant amount of computation is avoided when estimating motion. Novel strategies to avert advanced spoofing attempts (e.g., replayed videos which include person utterances) are demonstrated. We present favorable results on face detection for the YALE face test set and competitive results for the CMU-MIT frontal face test set as well as on "liveness" verification barriers. © 2007 IEEE.

AB This paper presents a novel liveness detection method that exploits the acquisition workflow for iris biometrics on smartphones using a hybrid visible (RGB)/near infra-red (NIR) sensor. These devices are able to capture both RGB and NIR images of the eye and iris region in synchronization. This multi-spectral information is mapped into a discrete feature space. An intermediate classifier which uses a distance metric close to Jenson-Shannon divergence is employed to classify the incoming image. Further, a fast, multi-frame pupil localization technique using one-dimensional processing of the eye region is proposed and evaluated. This is used to analyze the pupil characteristics of the images classified as 'live' in the previous stage. It is shown that such an analysis could detect presentation attacks, even with a 3-D face model made of materials that has properties similar to human skin and the ocular region1. © 1975-2011 IEEE.

AB A face recognition system can be deceived by photos, mimic masks, mannequins and etc. And with the advances in the 3D printing technology, a more robust face liveness detection method is needed. In this paper, a gradient-based multispectral method has been proposed for face liveness detection. Based on two spectral bands, the developed method is tested for the classification of genuine faces and common disguised faces. A true positive rate of 96.7% and a true negative rate of 97% have been achieved. The performance of the method is also tested when face rotation occurs. The contributions of this paper are: First, a gradient-based multispectral method has been proposed. Except for the reflectance of the skin regions, the reflectance of other distinctive regions in a face are also considered in the developed method. Second, the method is tested based on a dataset with both planar photos and 3D mannequins and masks. The performance on different face orientations is also discussed. © 2013 IEEE.

AB Among the facial pain syndromes, trigeminal neuralgia has a special position for many reasons. Already described in the Romans age, the specific features of its severe symptoms, the therapeutic debate and the recent curative possibilities, make this complex pain syndrome a unique entity. The clinical onset is predominantly unilateral and is described as an electric, lancinating, focal and sharp pain. It can last seconds to minutes initially, and sometimes can last as long as 1 hour. Usually the patient is symptom-free between attacks. Later in the course of the disease, patients report dull, aching, constant pain in the same distribution as the paroxysms. The pain can be triggered by non-noxious stimuli like chewing, talking, swallowing, wind on the face, cold and light touch. Thought to be attributable to fifth cranial nerve dysfunction, the first surgical attempts aimed to interrupt nerve continuity by means of a rizothomy, with disappearance of both pain and sensory disturbances. Further investigations claimed nerve compression by vascular structures as responsible of nervous dysfunction. Hence the attempt to perform a decompression in order to relieve the symptoms and maintain physiologic nerve function. From the successful attempts of first microvascular decompression descends the now standardised and widespread technique that is commonly used today to treat trigeminal neuralgia. © Springer-Verlag Italia 2008.

AB Many hybrid and multimodal biometric recognition techniques have been presented to provide secure and authentic systems, incorporating both soft and hard biometric schemes. This article proposes a new hybrid technique which ensures the authenticity of the user to the system, as well as monitors whether the user has passed the biometric system as a normal or spoofed one. The proposed scheme is two-fold: Tier I integrates fingerprint, palm vein print and face recognition to match with the corresponding databases, and Tier II uses fingerprint, palm vein print and face anti-spoofing convolutional neural networks (CNN) based models to detect spoofing. In first stage, the hash of a fingerprint is compared with the fingerprint database. After a successful match of the fingerprint, it is tested on a CNN-based model of the fingerprint to verify whether it is a spoof or real. A similar process is repeated for the palm and face, and based on collective evidence, the system permits the user to login the system. Experimental results over five benchmark datasets verified the effectiveness of the proposed system in providing efficient and robust verification, overcoming the limitations in normal authentication and spoofing practices. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI Time analysis of pulse-based face anti-spoofing in visible and NIR

AB In this paper we study Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) in face recognition systems against realistic artifacts such as 3D masks or good quality of photo attacks. In recent works, pulse detection based on remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has shown to be a effective countermeasure in concrete setups, but still there is a need for a deeper understanding of when and how this kind of PAD works in various practical conditions. Related works analyze full video sequences (usually over 60 seconds) to distinguish between attacks and legitimate accesses. However, existing approaches may not be as effective as it has been claimed in the literature in time variable scenarios. In this paper we evaluate the performance of an existent state-of-the-art PAD scheme based on rPPG when analyzing short-time video sequences extracted from a longer video. Results are reported using the 3D Mask Attack Database (3DMAD), and a self-collected dataset called Heart Rate Database (HR), including different video durations, spectrum bands, resolutions and frame rates. Several conclusions can be drawn from this work: a) PAD performance based on rPPG varies significantly with the length of the analyzed video, b) rPPG information extracted from short-time sequences (over 5 seconds) can be discriminant enough for performing the PAD task, c) in general, videos using the NIR band perform better than those using the RGB band, and d) the temporal resolution is more valuable for rPPG signal extraction than the spatial resolution. © 2018 IEEE.

AB Despite the significant attention given to the problem of face spoofing, we still lack generalized presentation attack detection (PAD) methods performing robustly in practical face recognition systems. The existing face anti-spoofing techniques have indeed achieved impressive results when trained and evaluated on the same database (i.e. intra-test protocols). Cross-database experiments have, however, revealed that the performance of the state-of-the-art methods drops drastically as they fail to cope with new attacks scenarios and other operating conditions that have not been seen during training and development phases. So far, even the popular convolutional neural networks (CNN) have failed to derive well-generalizing features for face anti-spoofing. In this work, we explore the effect of different factors, such as acquisition conditions and presentation attack instrument (PAI) variation, on the generalization of color texture-based face anti-spoofing. Our extensive cross-database evaluation of seven color texture-based methods demonstrates that most of the methods are unable to generalize to unseen spoofing attack scenarios. More importantly, the experiments show that some facial color texture representations are more robust to particular PAIs than others. From this observation, we propose a face PAD solution of attack-specific countermeasures based solely on color texture analysis and investigate how well it generalizes under display and print attacks in different conditions. The evaluation of the method combining attack-specific detectors on three benchmark face anti-spoofing databases showed remarkable generalization ability against display attacks while print attacks require still further attention. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Finger vein recognition is an emerging biometric technique for personal authentication that has garnered considerable attention in the past decade. Although shown to be effective, recent studies have revealed that finger vein biometrics is also vulnerable to presentation attacks, i.e., printed versions of authorized individual finger vein images can be used to gain access to facilities or services. In this paper, given that both blurriness and the noise distribution are slightly different between real and forged finger vein images, we propose an efficient and robust method for detecting presentation attacks that use forged finger vein images (print artifacts). First, we use total variation regularization to decompose original finger vein images into structure and noise components, which represent the degrees of blurriness and the noise distribution. Second, a block local binary pattern descriptor is used to encode both structure and noise information in the decomposed components. Finally, we use a cascaded support vector machine model for classification, by which finger vein presentation attacks can be effectively detected. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we constructed a new finger vein presentation attack database. Extensive experimental results gleaned from the two finger vein presentation attack databases and a palm vein presentation attack database show that our method clearly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB Finger-vein recognition, a new and advanced biometrics recognition method, is attracting the attention of researchers because of its advantages such as high recognition performance and lesser likelihood of theft and inaccuracies occurring on account of skin condition defects. However, as reported by previous researchers, it is possible to attack a finger-vein recognition system by using presentation attack (fake) finger-vein images. As a result, spoof detection, named as presentation attack detection (PAD), is necessary in such recognition systems. Previous attempts to establish PAD methods primarily focused on designing feature extractors by hand (handcrafted feature extractor) based on the observations of the researchers about the difference between real (live) and presentation attack finger-vein images. Therefore, the detection performance was limited. Recently, the deep learning framework has been successfully applied in computer vision and delivered superior results compared to traditional handcrafted methods on various computer vision applications such as image-based face recognition, gender recognition and image classification. In this paper, we propose a PAD method for near-infrared (NIR) camera-based finger-vein recognition system using convolutional neural network (CNN) to enhance the detection ability of previous handcrafted methods. Using the CNN method, we can derive a more suitable feature extractor for PAD than the other handcrafted methods using a training procedure. We further process the extracted image features to enhance the presentation attack finger-vein image detection ability of the CNN method using principal component analysis method (PCA) for dimensionality reduction of feature space and support vector machine (SVM) for classification. Through extensive experimental results, we confirm that our proposed method is adequate for presentation attack finger-vein image detection and it can deliver superior detection results compared to CNN-based methods and other previous handcrafted methods. © 2017 by the authors.

AB We present a new type of local image descriptor which yields binary patterns from small image patches. For the application to fingerprint liveness detection, we achieve rotation invariant image patches by taking the fingerprint segmentation and orientation field into account. We compute the discrete cosine transform (DCT) for these rotation invariant patches and attain binary patterns by comparing pairs of two DCT coefficients. These patterns are summarized into one or more histograms per image. Each histogram comprises the relative frequencies of pattern occurrences. Multiple histograms are concatenated and the resulting feature vector is used for image classification. We name this novel type of descriptor convolution comparison pattern (CCP). Experimental results show the usefulness of the proposed CCP descriptor for fingerprint liveness detection. CCP outperforms other local image descriptors such as LBP, LPQ and WLD on the LivDet 2013 benchmark. The CCP descriptor is a general type of local image descriptor which we expect to prove useful in areas beyond fingerprint liveness detection such as biological and medical image processing, texture recognition, face recognition and iris recognition, liveness detection for face and iris images, and machine vision for surface inspection and material classification. © 2016 Carsten Gottschlich.

AB Background: Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is diagnosed on echocardiography by saline contrast study with or without color Doppler evidence of shunting. PFO is benign except when it causes embolic events. Methods and Results: In this report, we describe unique additional manifestations related to the diagnosis and presentation of PFO. These include demonstration of PFO during the release phase of "sigh" on the ventilator in the operating room, use of a separate venipuncture to allow preparation of blood-saline-air mixture after multiple failed saline bubble injections, resting and stress hypoxemia related to left to right shunting across a PFO in the absence of pulmonary hypertension, presentation of quadriperesis secondary to an embolic event from a PFO and development of a thrombus on the left atrial aspect of PFO in a patient with atrial fibrillation, and on the right atrial aspect of PFO in a patient who had undergone repair of a flail mitral valve. Finally, in one patient with end-stage renal disease, aortic valve endocarditis and periaortic abscess, PFO acted as a vent valve relieving right atrial pressure following development of aortoatrial fistula. Conclusion: PFO diagnosis can be elusive if appropriate techniques are not used during saline contrast administration. PFO can present as hypoxemia in the absence of pulmonary hypertension, can be a rare cause of quadriperesis, and can be associated with thrombus formation on either side of interatrial septum. Finally, PFO presence can be lifesaving in those with sudden increase in right atrial pressure such as with aortoatrial fistula. © 2010, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Existing face liveness detection algorithms adopt behavioural challenge-response methods that require user cooperation. To be verified live, users are expected to obey some user unfriendly requirement. In this paper, we present a multispectral face liveness detection method, which is user cooperation free. Moreover, the system is adaptive to various user-system distances. Using the Lambertian model, we analyze multispectral properties of human skin versus non-skin, and the discriminative wavelengths are then chosen. Reflectance data of genuine and fake faces at multi-distances are selected to form a training set. An SVM classifier is trained to learn the multispectral distribution for a final Genuine-or-Fake classification. Compared with previous works, the proposed method has the following advantages: (a) The requirement on the users' cooperation is no longer needed, making the liveness detection user friendly and fast. (b) The system can work without restricted distance requirement from the target being analyzed. Experiments are conducted on genuine versus planar face data, and genuine versus mask face data. Furthermore a comparison with the visible challenge-response liveness detection method is also given. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous systems. © 2011 IEEE.

AB Cervical arterial dissections and dissecting aneurysms are relatively rare pathologies, but can be associated with significant morbidity from ischemic complications. We review the challenges in diagnosing cervical arterial dissections, their unique clinical presentations and imaging characteristics. Although the majority of cervical dissections heal spontaneously with medical management, we discuss the specific indications for surgical or endovascular treatment to prevent thromboembolic complications. Furthermore, we provide a detailed technical review on endovascular stent reconstruction, the primary interventional option for symptomatic cervical dissections and dissecting aneurysms refractory to medical management. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this paper we show the potential of two new features as powerful anti-spoofing measures for face-voice person authentication systems. The features based on latent semantic analysis (LSA) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA), enhance the performance of the authentication system in terms of better anti-imposture abilities and guard against video replay attacks, which is a challenging type of spoof attack. Experiments conducted on 2 speaking-face databases, VidTIMIT and UCBN, show around 42% improvement in error rate with CCA features and 61% improvement with LSA features over feature-level fusion of face-voice feature vectors.

AB In many areas of secondary care, symptoms unexplained by disease account for around one-third of all patients seen. We sought to investigate patients presenting with medically unexplained stroke-like symptoms to identify distinguishing features which may help to identify a non-organic aetiology. Patients given a discharge diagnosis of medically unexplained stroke-like symptoms over the preceding 11 years were identified retrospectively from a prospectively completed stroke unit database. Age- and sex-matched controls with ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke or transient ischaemic attack were also identified. Clinical features on presentation, ischaemic risk factors, alcohol history, marital status and history of depression or anxiety were examined. Previous or subsequent admissions with medically unexplained syndromes were also examined via record linkage with hospital discharge records. A medically unexplained syndrome was assumed to be present if an International Classification of Diseases 9 discharge code for one or more of the thirteen conditions forming recognized functional syndromes was given. Logistic regression was applied to determine predictors of non-organicity. One hundred and five patients and controls, 1.6% of all stroke unit admissions were identified, 62% (65 patients) were females. Mean age was 50.3 ± 14.9. Compared with age- and sex-matched controls patients with medically unexplained stroke-like symptoms were significantly more probable to have a headache at presentation (47% vs. 26%, P = 0.0004), have a diagnosis of one or more additional medically unexplained syndromes (24% vs. 11%, P = 0.007) but significantly less probable to present with symptoms of vertebrobasilar dysfunction (32% vs. 61%, P < 0.0001). A history of anxiety or depression, as recorded in the notes, was not found to be associated with a medically unexplained presentation.Medically unexplained stroke-like presentations are common (1.6% of all stroke presentations), they are most strongly predicted by the presence of other functional somatic syndromes, headache and the absence of symptoms of vertebrobasilar dysfunction.

AB We investigate the vulnerability of convolutional neural network (CNN) based face-recognition (FR) systems to presentation attacks (PA) performed using custom-made silicone masks. Previous works have studied the vulnerability of CNN-FR systems to 2D PAs such as print-attacks, or digital- video replay attacks, and to rigid 3D masks. This is the first study to consider PAs performed using custom-made flexible silicone masks. Before embarking on research on detecting a new variety of PA, it is important to estimate the seriousness of the threat posed by the type of PA. In this work we demonstrate that PAs using custom silicone masks do pose a serious threat to state-of-the-art FR systems. Using a new dataset based on six custom silicone masks, we show that the vulnerability of each FR system in this study is at least 10 times higher than its false match rate. We also propose a simple but effective presentation attack detection method, based on a low-cost thermal camera. © 2018 IEEE.

AB Biometric systems have been actively emerging in various industries in the past few years and continue to provide higher-security features for access control systems. Many types of unimodal biometric systems have been developed. However, these systems are only capable of providing low- to mid-range security features. Thus, for higher-security features, the combination of two or more unimodal biometrics (multiple modalities) is required. In this paper, we propose a multimodal biometric system for person recognition using face, fingerprint, and finger vein images. Addressing this problem, we propose an efficient matching algorithm that is based on secondary calculation of the Fisher vector and uses three biometric modalities: face, fingerprint, and finger vein. The three modalities are combined and fusion is performed at the feature level. Furthermore, based on the method of feature fusion, the paper studies the fake feature which appears in the practical scene. The liveness detection is append to the system, detect the picture is real or fake based on DCT, then remove the fake picture to reduce the influence of accuracy rate, and increase the robust of system. The experimental results showed that the designed framework can achieve an excellent recognition rate and provide higher security than a unimodal biometric-based system, which are very important for a IoMT platform. © 2018 IEEE.

AB Advancements in smartphone applications have empowered even non-technical users to perform sophisticated operations such as morphing in faces as few tap operations. While such enablements have positive effects, as a negative side, now anyone can digitally attack face (biometric) recognition systems. For example, face swapping application of Snapchat can easily create 'swapped' identities and circumvent face recognition system. This research presents a novel database, termed as SWAPPED - Digital Attack Video Face Database, prepared using Snap chat's application which swaps/stitches two faces and creates videos. The database contains bonafide face videos and face swapped videos of multiple subjects. Baseline face recognition experiments using commercial system shows over 90% rank-1 accuracy when attack videos are used as probe. As a second contribution, this research also presents a novel Weighted Local Magnitude Pattern feature descriptor based presentation attack detection algorithm which outperforms several existing approaches. © 2017 IEEE.

AB Electrocardiogram (ECG) is not only a vital sign of life but also contains important clinical information and even identical features. Similarly, ECG provides various significant characteristics to advocate its use as a biometric system such as uniqueness, permanence and liveness detection etc. This research provides with the complete systematic approach of ECG based person identification for general population and consists of preprocessing of signal for noise reduction, feature extraction, feature selection and classifier performance. Feature extraction was performed by extraction of cardiac cycle followed by discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to extract wavelet coefficients as feature vector. Feature reduction is performed with best first search and classification is performed by using single nearest neighbor classifier. System is tested on three publicly available databases like MIT-BIH/Arrhythmia (MITDB), MIT-BIH/Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSRDB) and ECG-ID database (ECG-IDDB) including all subjects both separately and in combined manner. For arrhythmic database, identification rate of 93.1% was achieved by using proposed methodology. System is also tested on normal population based databases and accuracy of 99.4% is achieved using NSRDB database and 82.3% for a challenging ECG-ID database. The combined approach for general population results in accuracy of 94.4% with false acceptance rate (FAR) of 5.1% and false rejection rate of 0.1%, proving the effectiveness of suggested approach as non invasive for general population with better results as compared to previous approaches in literature. © 2015 IEEE.

AB In order to develop security systems for identity authentication, face recognition (FR) technology has been applied. One of the main problems of applying FR technology is that the systems are especially vulnerable to attacks with spoofing faces (e.g., 2D pictures). To defend from these attacks and to enhance the reliability of FR systems, many anti-spoofing approaches have been recently developed. In this paper, we propose a method for face liveness detection using the effect of defocus. From two images sequentially taken at different focuses, three features, focus, power histogram and gradient location and orientation histogram (GLOH), are extracted. Afterwards, we detect forged faces through the feature-level fusion approach. For reliable performance verification, we develop two databases with a handheld digital camera and a webcam. The proposed method achieves a 3.29% half total error rate (HTER) at a given depth of field (DoF) and can be extended to camera-equipped devices, like smartphones. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB Mutations in the TBC1D24 gene were first reported in an Italian family with a unique epileptic phenotype consisting of drug-responsive, early-onset idiopathic myoclonic seizures. Patients presented with isolated bilateral or focal myoclonia, which could evolve to long-lasting attacks without loss of consciousness, with a peculiar reflex component, and were associated with generalized tonic-clonic seizures. This entity was named "familial infantile myoclonic epilepsy" (FIME). More recently, TBC1D24 mutations have been shown to cause a variable range of disorders, including epilepsy of various seizure types and severity, non-syndromic deafness, and DOORS syndrome.We report on the electro-clinical features of two brothers, born to first-cousin parents, affected with infantile-onset myoclonic epilepsy. The peculiar epileptic presentation prompted us to perform direct sequencing of the TBC1D24 gene. The patients had very early onset of focal myoclonic fits with variable topography, lasting a few minutes to several hours, without loss of consciousness, which frequently evolved to generalized myoclonus or myoclonic status. Reflex myoclonia were noticed in one patient. Neurological outcome was marked by moderate intellectual disability. Despite the high frequency of seizures, repeated EEG recordings showed normal background rhythm and rare interictal spikes and waves. We found a homozygous missense mutation, c.457G>A/p.Glu153Lys, in the two affected brothers. This observation combined with recent data from the literature, suggest that mutations in TBCD24 cause a pathological continuum, with FIME at the "benign" end and severe drug-refractory epileptic encephalopathy on the severe end. Early-onset myoclonic epilepsy with focal and generalized myoclonic seizures is a common characteristic of this continuum. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Headache is the most frequent reason for referral to an outpatient neurology and pain physician practice, with post-traumatic headache (PTH) accounting for approximately 4% of all symptomatic headaches. Headache following trauma has been reported for centuries. In this unique case report we will discuss the clinical course and successful headache treatment of a 57-year-old man diagnosed with PTHs. He suffered from chronic, intractable headaches resistant to multidisciplinary medical management for 4 years. A trial of electrical neuromodulation of the C2-C3 branches within the great auricular nerve (GAN) distribution was proposed as a potential long-term treatment for his chronic, intractable headaches after having several prior headache attacks successfully aborted with ultrasoundguided GAN blocks. Six months after permanent peripheral neurostimulator implantation, the patient reported a greater than 90% reduction in headache frequency, and was able to wean off all his previous prophylactic and abortive headache medications, with the exception of over-the-counter ibuprofen as needed. Subcutaneous electrode application over the branches of C2-C3-namely greater, lesser, and the least occipital nerves-for the treatment of chronic, intractable headache is not a new concept within pain medicine literature. However, subcutaneous electrode application, specifically over the GAN, is unique. The following case report chronicles the novel application of ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve stimulation of the GAN as an effective and safe longterm treatment for chronic, intractable primary headache. The positive outcome chronicled in this case presentation suggests that peripheral nerve stimulation of the GAN should be considered for highly select cases. To our knowledge, this is the first such case report describing GAN as a target for the management of PTH in the literature.

AB Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) are not homogeneous and may consist of subsets with mechanisms as varied as their stroke counterparts. We describe a form of TIA in 50 patients where crescendo episodes of ischemia were restricted to the region of the internal capsule, usually causing symptoms affecting face, arm, and leg. These patients composed 4.5% of a consecutive series of patients admitted with TIAs over a 15-year period and 33% of all TIAs classified as subcortical. We believe that the ischemia was most often due to hemodynamic phenomena in diseased, single, small penetrating vessels. When cerebral infarction developed, it was usually lacunar and involved a single penetrating vessel, although occasionally striatocapsular or anterior choroidal artery territory infarction occurred. There was no evidence of artery-to-artery or heart-to-artery embolism. Resistance to various forms of therapy, including hemodiluting, anticoagulant, and thrombolytic agents, was common. Because of dramatic and easily recognizable clinical presentation, apparent specific pathophysiologic mechanism, and the development of early capsular stroke in a high proportion of cases (42%), we have termed this the “capsular warning syndrome.” © 1993 American Academy of Neurology.

AB Among others, spoofing with photos is one of the most common manner to intrude a face recognition system. In this paper, we presents a novel method to deal with this problem, based on the observation that the difference between a photo and a real face usually leads to different distribution behavior in the frequency domain. In particular, we propose to first use a DoG (Difference of Gaussian) filter on the given image to preserve rich information for the subsequent stages while suppressing less-discriminative energy as much as possible. A two-dimensional discrete Fourier transformation is then applied on the filtered image, which produces an input to a sparse logistic regression model to give the final determinant. Furthermore, we adopt an early stoping strategy to prevent the logistic model from overfiting when our training set has class imbalance problem. We also investigate the influence of degree of sparsity on the performance of the system. Extensive experiments on a large scale testing set verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. ©2009 IEEE.

AB Background: Conventional dissemination of clinical trial results has inconsistent impact on physician practices. A more comprehensive plan to influence determinants of prescribing practices is warranted. Purpose: To report the response from the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's requirement for dissemination and evaluation of trials with potential immediate public health applicability. Methods: ALLHAT's dissemination plan had two-components: (1) a traditional approach of media coverage, scientific presentation, and publication; and (2) a theory-based approach targeting determinants of clinician behavior. Strategies included: (1) academic detailing, in which physicians approach colleagues regarding blood pressure management, (2) direct patient messages to stimulate communication with physicians regarding blood pressure control, (3) approaches to formulary systems to use educational and economic incentives for evidence-based prescription, and (4) direct professional organization appeals to clinicians. Results: One hundred and forty-seven Investigator Educators reported 1698 presentations to 18,524 clinicians in 41 states and the District of Columbia. The pre- and post-test responses of 1709 clinicians in the face-to-face meetings indicated significant changes in expectations for positive patient outcomes and intention to prescribe diuretics. Information was mailed to 55 individuals representing 20 professional organizations and to eight formulary systems. Direct-to-patient messages were provided to 14 sites that host patient newsletters and Web sites such as health plans and insurance companies, 62 print mass media outlets, and 12 broadcast media sites. Limitations: It was not within the scope of the project to conduct a randomized trial of the impact of the dissemination. However, impact evaluation using quasi-experimental designs is ongoing. Conclusion: A large multi-method dissemination of clinical trial results is feasible. Planning for dissemination efforts, including evaluation research, should be considered as a part of the funding and design of the clinical trial and should begin early in trial planning. © The Author(s), 2009.

AB A 15-year-old, unmarried female presented to our dermatology department for an intensely pruritic skin rash that had appeared abruptly 3 days earlier. She had a remarkable medical history for a case of allergic rhinitis and several attacks of asthma in her early childhood. The condition waxed and waned initially but had improved in recent years. Physical examination revealed several erythematous plaques, papules studded with scattered pustules having diameters less than 0.3 mm. Conspicuous scratch marks had caused erythematous wheal-like indurations also studded with pustules in a linear distribution across the waist, forearms (Fig. 1), and back (Fig. 2). Discrete papulopustules were present on the face, nape and neck.The patient was otherwise healthy. There were no other symptoms such as fever, malaise, weakness, or lymphadenopathy Laboratory results were normal for hepatic and renal functions, serum electrolytes, glucose, protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (8 mm/h), and C-reactive protein (0.355 mg/l). A human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody screen test was negative. Serum was positive for herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 and HSV-2 IgG (in low titers), but negative for HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgM. White blood cell count revealed leukocytosis (11.2 × 103/l), with a differential count of 68% neutrophils, 27% lymphocytes, and 8% eosinophils. Serum IgA, IgG, and IgM were within normal limits, but the IgE level was elevated (677 mg/dl). Cultures from peripheral blood and pustules were negative. A Tzank smear performed on the pustules showed no multinucleated giant cells. Fungal testing of skin scrapings from the initial lesion site gave negative results. Routine stool tests, including common pathogen and parasite screens, were negative, and urinalysis results were unremarkable. A biopsy specimen obtained from a skin pustule showed subcorneal eosinophilic and neutrophilic pustules in the follicular infundibulum with marked spongiosis of the follicular epithelium. (Fig. 3). There was a moderately dense superficial and deep perivascular mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate comprising eosinophils, neutrophils and lymphocytes. Migration of eosinophils and neutrophils through the vessel wall with variable luminal intramural fibrin deposition, histologically indicative of vasculopathy, was seen. There was concomitant slight perivascular dermal necrosis. (Fig. 4) Based on the clinical presentation and light microscopic findings on biopsy, a diagnosis of eosinophilic pustular folliculitis with pathergy was made. Systemic prednisolone 30 mg in divided doses was given. After 1 week of systemic corticosteroid therapy, the patient's condition was significantly improved and the patient was subsequently discharged. Two month

AB Aiming to counter presentation attack (also known as spoofing attack) in face recognition system, a face presentation attack detection (also known as spoofing detection or liveness detection) scheme based on guided scale texture is proposed. In order to minimize the influence of the redundant noise contamination, guided scale space is proposed to reduce the redundancy of the original facial texture and to extract more powerful facial edges. Based on the guided scale space, two guided scale texture descriptors are proposed to extract liveness detection features, and they are guided scale based local binary pattern (GS-LBP) and local guided binary pattern (LGBP). GS-LBP takes advantage of the edge-preserving property of the guided scale space, and joint quantization is used in LGBP to encode the neighboring relationships of the original face and the guided scale face without using additional features. With the guided scale texture features, presentation attack detection is accomplished by the use of a linear support vector machine classifier. Experiments are done with public MSU MFSD, CASIA FASD, Replay-Attack and Replay-Mobile databases, and the results indicate its effectiveness. The proposed method can effectively be applied for countering photo attack and video attack in face recognition systems. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB The vulnerability of deep-learning-based face-recognition (FR) methods, to presentation attacks (PA), is studied in this study. Recently, proposed FR methods based on deep neural networks (DNN) have been shown to outperform most other methods by a significant margin. In a trustworthy face-verification system, however, maximising recognition-performance alone is not sufficient – the system should also be capable of resisting various kinds of attacks, including PA. Previous experience has shown that the PA vulnerability of FR systems tends to increase with face-verification accuracy. Using several publicly available PA datasets, the authors show that DNN-based FR systems compensate for variability between bona fide and PA samples, and tend to score them similarly, which makes such FR systems extremely vulnerable to PAs. Experiments show the vulnerability of the studied DNN-based FR systems to be consistently higher than 90%, and often higher than 98%. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017

AB Authentication of users by exploiting face as a biometric is gaining widespread traction due to recent advances in face detection and recognition algorithms. While face recognition has made rapid advances in its performance, such facebased authentication systems remain vulnerable to biometric presentation attacks. Biometric presentation attacks are varied and the most common attacks include the presentation of a video or photograph on a display device, the presentation of a printed photograph or the presentation of a face mask resembling the user to be authenticated. In this paper, we present PPGSecure, a novel methodology that relies on camera-based physiology measurements to detect and thwart such biometric presentation attacks. PPGSecure uses a photoplethysmogram (PPG), which is an estimate of vital signs from the small color changes in the video observed due to minor pulsatile variations in the volume of blood flowing to the face. We demonstrate that the temporal frequency spectra of the estimated PPG signal for real live individuals are distinctly different than those of presentation attacks and exploit these differences to detect presentation attacks. We demonstrate that PPGSecure achieves significantly better performance than existing state of the art presentation attack detection methods. © 2017 IEEE.

AB The proposed system aims to boost the performance of a face anti-spoofing system by fusing pulse based features with other spatial and temporal information that markedly define liveness. Most face recognition systems do not have an effective spoof detection module and hence are vulnerable to spoofing attacks. We address the above problem by developing a spatio-temporal mapping of face and then using a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn discriminative features for liveness detection. CNNs can act directly on the raw inputs, thus automating the process of feature construction. Instead of only relying on the deep CNN to learn features by skimming through all the frames of a sequence, a compact representation of face that captures only the selective features is given as an input. Features are extracted from both spatial and temporal dimensions through spectral analysis, thereby capturing the motion and physiological information encoded in multiple adjacent frames. The developed model generates multiple channels of information from the input frames, and the final feature representation is obtained by combining information from all channels. Our model differs from other models in this aspect. Our system is evaluated on two challenging databases, CASIA [27] and Replay-Attack [7], and the achieved results are presented in this paper. This work shows that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CASIA, achieves comparable result on REPLAY-ATTACK and reduces model complexity by exploiting few key features of liveness. © 2017 IEEE.

AB The face biometric systems are highly vulnerable for the presentation attack that can be carried out by presenting a photo or video or even a 3D mask. In this paper, we present a novel Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) algorithm that can accurately detect and mitigate the 3D mask attacks on a face recognition system. The proposed scheme extracts both local and global features from the captured face image. The local features employed in this work corresponds to the eye (periocular) and nose region that are expected to provide clue on the presence of the mask. In addition, we also capture the micro-texture variation as a global feature using Binarized Statistical Image Features (BSIF). We then train a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) independently on these two features whose scores are fused using the weighted sum rule before making the decision about a real face or an artefact. Extensive experiments are carried out on the public 3D mask database 3DMAD that shows the superiority of the proposed scheme with an outstanding performance of HTER = 0.03%. © 2014 IEEE.

AB Background: Previous studies have suggested that patients with a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor ischemic stroke and isolated aphasia should be carefully screened for a potential cardiac source of embolism. Most of these publications, however, were case reports or small-series. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between isolated aphasia and atrial fibrillation (AF) as the cause of presumed cardioembolic TIA or stroke within the setting of 2 large multicenter trials. Methods: The frequency of isolated aphasia was compared between patients with a TIA or minor ischemic stroke either with AF [European Atrial Fibrillation Trial (EAFT), n = 1,001] or without AF [Dutch TIA Trial (DTT), n = 3,150]. We analyzed data with univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Isolated aphasia was defined as aphasia without dysarthria, visual-field defects or motor or sensory deficits of the arm, leg or face. Because dysarthria can be difficult to detect in aphasic patients, a second analysis was done without excluding dysarthric patients. In a third analysis, we excluded patients with a symptomatic lacunar infarct from the DTT, as these patients were overrepresented due to the exclusion of patients with AF. Subgroup analysis was performed for patients presenting with TIA and minor stroke. Results: Of 4,151 patients, 210 (5.1%) had isolated aphasia, 109 from the EAFT and 101 from the DTT, crude odds ratio (OR) 3.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.79-4.89. Patients with isolated aphasia were older (mean age 70.3 vs. 66.8 years, p < 0.01), more often female (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.41-2.46), and more often had diabetes (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.16-2.59) and hypercholesterolemia (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.11-3.03) than those without aphasia. After simultaneous adjustment for age, sex, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, patients with isolated aphasia still had AF more often than patients without isolated aphasia (adjusted OR 2.94, 95% CI 2.16-4.01). Both after inclusion of patients with dysarthria in the group of patients with isolated aphasia and after exclusion of patients with a symptomatic lacunar infarct, essentially the results remained the same. Patients presenting with isolated aphasia due to a TIA tended to have AF more often than patients with a minor ischemic stroke. Conclusions: Isolated aphasia is an independent sign of AF in patients with a TIA or minor ischemic stroke. Careful cardiac screening seems warranted in patients with isolated aphasia, as secondary prevention is different in patients with a cardiac source of embolism. Copyright © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB Rendering a face recognition system robust is vital in order to safeguard it against spoof attacks carried out using printed pictures of a victim (also known as print attack) or a replayed video of the person (replay attack). A key property in distinguishing a live, valid access from printed media or replayed videos is by exploiting the information dynamics of the video content, such as blinking eyes, moving lips, and facial dynamics. We advance the state of the art in facial antispoofing by applying a recently developed algorithm called dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) as a general purpose, entirely data-driven approach to capture the above liveness cues. We propose a classification pipeline consisting of DMD, local binary patterns (LBPs), and support vector machines (SVMs) with a histogram intersection kernel. A unique property of DMD is its ability to conveniently represent the temporal information of the entire video as a single image with the same dimensions as those images contained in the video. The pipeline of DMD + LBP + SVM proves to be efficient, convenient to use, and effective. In fact only the spatial configuration for LBP needs to be tuned. The effectiveness of the methodology was demonstrated using three publicly available databases: 1) print-attack; 2) replay-attack; and 3) CASIA-FASD, attaining comparable results with the state of the art, following the respective published experimental protocols. © 2015 IEEE.

AB In this paper, we propose a new palm vessel biometric sensing system based on photoacoustic imaging, which is an emerging technique that allows high-resolution visualization of optical absorption in deep tissue. Our system consists of an ultrasound (US) linear transducer array, an US data acquisition system, and an Nd:YAG laser emitting 1064-nm wavelength. By scanning the array, we could get a 3-D image of palm vasculature. The 3-D image is further combined with our newly developed algorithm, Earth Mover's Distance - Radiographic Testing, to provide precise matching and robust recognition rate. Compared to conventional vein sensing techniques, our system demonstrates deeper imaging depth and better spatial resolution, offering securer biometric features to fight against counterfeits. In this paper, we imaged 20 different hands at various poses and quantified our system performance. We found that the usability and accuracy of our system are comparable to conventional biometric techniques, such as fingerprint imaging and face identification. Our technique can open up avenues for better liveness detection and biometric measurements. © 2001-2012 IEEE.

AB Presentation attack on the face recognition systems is well studied in the biometrics community resulting in various techniques for detecting the attacks. A low-cost presentation attack (e.g. print attacks) on face recognition systems has been demonstrated for systems operating in visible, multispectral (visible and near infrared spectrum) and extended multispectral (more than two spectral bands spanning from visible to near infrared space, commonly in 500nm-1000nm). In this paper, we propose a novel method to detect the presentation attacks on the extended multispectral face recognition systems. The proposed method is based on characterising the reflectance properties of the captured image through the spectral signature. The spectral signature is further classified using the linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) to obtain the decision on presented sample as an artefact or bona-fide. Since the reflectance property of the human skin and the artefact material differ, the proposed method can efficiently detect the presentation attacks on the extended multispectral system. Extensive experiments are carried out on a publicly available extended multispectral database (EMSPAD) comprised of 50 subjects with two different Presentation Attack Instrument (PAI) generated using two different printers. The comparison analysis is presented by comparing the performance of the proposed scheme with the contemporary schemes based on the image fusion and PAD score level fusion. Based on the obtained results, the proposed method has indicated the best performance in detecting both known and unknown attacks. © 2017 IEEE.

AB Face anti-spoofing is a hot research area in computer vision. With the progress of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in computer vision, some work has introduced neural networks into face anti-spoofing. However, the neural networks that most of the approaches use consist of only a few layers due to the limitation of training data. Inspired by the fact that deep efficiently trained neural networks are often possible to learn better representation than shallow networks. In this paper, we propose a fully data-driven ultra-deep model based on transfer learning. The model adopts a pre-trained deep residual network to learn highly discriminative features, and combines it with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units to discover long-range temporal relationships of from video frames for classification. We conduct extensive experiments on two most common benchmark datasets, namely, REPLAY-ATTACK and CASIA-FASD. Experimental results demonstrate that our ultra-deep network framework archives state-of-the-art performance. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB In recent years, facial biometric systems have received increased deployment in various applications such as surveillance, access control and forensic investigations. However, one of the limitations of face recognition system is the high possibility of the system being deceived or spoofed by non-real faces such as photograph, video clips or dummy faces. In order to identify the spoofing attacks on such biometric systems, face liveness detection approaches have been developed. Thus, the current approach is to integrate liveness detection within facial biometrics by using life sign indicators of individual features. This article presents a review of state-of-the-art techniques in face liveness detection, which are classified into two groups, namely intrusive and non-intrusive approaches. Here, each technique is discussed in terms of its implementation, strengths and limitations, as well as indications on possible future research directions that can be studied.

AB Face spoofing attack is one of the recent security problems that face recognition systems are proven to be vulnerable to. The spoofing occurs when an attacker bypass the authentication scheme by presenting a copy of the face image for a valid user. Therefore, it's very easy to perform a face recognition spoofing attack with compare to other biometrics. This paper, presents a novel and efficient facial image representation for face spoofing called improved local graph structure (ILGS). We divide the input facial image into several regions and then we calculate local graph structure (LGS) codes for each region. On the other hand, the histograms are concatenated into an enhanced feature vector to detect spoofed facial image. Finally, performance of the proposed method is evaluated on the NUAA database. © 2014 IEEE.

AB To increase the trust in using face recognition systems, these need to be capable of differentiating between face images captured from a real person and those captured from photos or similar artifacts presented at the sensor. Methods have been published for face liveness detection by measuring the gaze of a user while the user tracks an object on the screen, which appears at pre-defined, places randomly. In this paper we explore the sensitivity of such a system to different stimulus alignments. The aim is to establish whether there is such sensitivity and if so to explore how this may be exploited for improving the design of the stimulus. The results suggest that collecting feature points along the horizontal direction is more effective than the vertical direction for liveness detection. © 2013 IEEE.

AB It is widely accepted that biometric authentication systems based on human faces are vulnerable to spoofing attacks, in which attackers exploit recaptured photos of legitimate users to gain unauthorized access. To address this vulnerability, numerous approaches which employ complex physics-based models to verify the live-ness of presented images have been proposed. While capable of distinguishing between real and recaptured images, a key weakness of these methods is their reliance on an appropriate choice of the model used. Here, we adopt a fundamentally different approach to detect recaptured images. Our method uses randomized temporal affective cues in the form of facial expressions to verify the liveness of users. A quantitative evaluation user study involving 6 users demonstrated the feasibility of our method, and we have also shown that the system is capable of achieving an average classification accuracy of 95.85% for different facial expressions. © 2012 ICPR Org Committee.

AB Objective: This study examined the knowledge of stroke warning signs and risk factors among the general public, including what they would do if they were to develop such symptoms. Design, setting and participants: Population study of randomly selected members of the general public in Adelaide, South Australia. A simple survey assessed knowledge of stroke warning signs and gave four options for management. The survey was conducted on three separate occasions: before, immediately after and 3 months after the National Stroke Foundation's National Stroke Week in 2009. Main outcome measures: The outcome measures were the public perception of risk factors and warning signs of stroke and what the members of the public would do if presented with a range of warning signs. They were also asked about their knowledge of the Face, Arms, Speech, Time (FAST) test. Results: The three surveys were completed by 251 members of the public. Hypertension and smoking were recognised as risk factors for stroke by 71% and 53% of respondents respectively. Before National Stroke Week, slurred speech was identified by 51% and both slurred speech and upper limb sensory loss was identified by 62% as warning signs to provoke presentation to an emergency department (ED). Amaurosis, upper limb sensory loss, upper limb numbness and upper limb weakness were correctly identified individually as warning signs to attend an ED by fewer than one-third of respondents. There was no significant difference in the survey results following National Stroke Week. Conclusions: Public awareness of the symptoms of stroke, and what to do about them, is limited. There was little improvement after the national week-long awareness campaign. The lack of public awareness about stroke warning signs must be addressed to reduce mortality and morbidity from stroke.

AB In this paper we propose liveness checking technique for multimodal biometric authentication systems based on audio-visual cross-modal fusion. Liveness checking ensures that biometric cues are acquired from a live person who is actually present at the time of capture for authenticating the identity. The liveness check based on mutual dependency models is performed by fusion of acoustic and visual speech features which measure the degree of synchrony between the lips and the voice extracted from speaking face video sequences. Performance evaluation in terms of DET (Detector Error Tradeoff) curves and EERs(Equal Error Rates) on publicly available audiovisual speech databases show a significant improvement in performance of proposed fusion of face-voice features based on mutual dependency models. ©2009 ISIF.

AB I. Acute urticaria/angioedema. A recent episode of urticaria/angioedema lasting less than 6 weeks is characterized as acute, while lesions recurring for more than six weeks are termed chronic. In acute urticaria/angioedema, the etiology may be readily apparent to both the patient and the physician. For example, the patient who presents with acute urticaria after drug administration, insect sting, or repetitive physical triggers will often note an association. The longer the urticaria persists the more difficult it is to determine a specific etiology. Urticaria should be considered when the patient presents with pruritic (and sometimes painful or burning), erythematous, circumscribed (or coalescent) wheals. Urticarial lesions commonly involve the extremities and trunk but may appear on any part of the body. In contrast to urticaria, angioedema presents as deeper subcutaneous swelling. Less circumscribed than the lesions of urticaria, angioedema has a predilection to areas of loose connective tissue such as the face or mucous membranes involving the lips or tongue. If angioedema involves the upper respiratory tract, life-threatening obstruction of the laryngeal airway may occur. Hereditary or acquired angioedema associated with C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency are particularly prone to this presentation, although other forms of angioedema can present either with laryngeal or glossopharyngeal edema causing hoarseness and difficulty in swallowing. The etiology of urticaria/angioedema can often be deduced by a detailed history. The patient should be asked about recent use of medications (including herbals and supplements), food exposures, physical triggers, viral infections, contactants, occupational and natural allergen exposures or systemic diseases which can manifest as acute urticaria. The physical examination should include the skin, lymph nodes, eyes, ears, throat, neck, joints, lungs, heart, and abdomen in an effort to detect an underlying causal condition. Findings ascertained by history or physical examination may direct attention towards an identifiable trigger or cause of urticaria/angioedema. Given the vast number of potential urticarial triggers and the difficulty in identifying them, any clues uncovered by history and physical may be extremely important. Evaluation of a suspected cause of acute urticaria/angioedema is often based on a clear temporal relationship between onset of symptoms and exposure to a specific food, insect sting or drug. If IgE-mediated penicillin-induced hives is suspected, predictive diagnostic skin tests are available. Allergy skin testing and/or in vitro tests may be useful in determining whether anaphylactogenic foods or inhalants are the cause of urticaria. Viral

AB A technique evaluating liveness in face image sequences is presented. To ensure the actual presence of a live face in contrast to a photograph (playback attack), is a significant problem in face authentication to the extent that anti-spoofing measures are highly desirable. The purpose of the proposed system is to assist in a biometric authentication framework, by adding liveness awareness in a non-intrusive manner. Analyzing the trajectories of certain parts of a live face reveals valuable information to discriminate it against a spoofed one. The proposed system uses a lightweight novel optical flow, which is especially applicable in face motion estimation based on the structure tensor and inputs of a few frames. For reliable face part detection, the system utilizes a model-based local Gabor decomposition and SVM experts, where selected points from a retinotopic grid are used to form regional face models. Also the estimated optical flow is exploited to detect a face part. The whole procedure, starting with three images as input and finishing in a liveness score, is executed in near real-time without special purpose hardware. Experimental results on the proposed system are presented on both a public database and spoofing attack simulations. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Angioedema usually presents as episodic attacks of swelling of the face, airway and extremities, but it may also involve visceral tissues. A 58-year-old woman with repeated episodes of abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting had two laparotomies and was treated for Crohn's disease for two years before a diagnosis of acquired intestinal angioedema was made. This case provides important insights into the presentation of intestinal angioedema.

AB Nowadays, cloud computing has provided enterprises and users with several capabilities to process and store their data in various cloud data centers. Storing and processing these sensitive data with better protection and management are a big challenge. Therefore, there is a need for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of data in the cloud without any information leakage. Recently, biometric recognition has achieved significant advancements in the identification of individuals for the purpose of privacy-preservation in the cloud computing. Only few works have used a face as a typical biometric trait for cloud and cross-enterprise identification in the last recent years. However, current cloud-based biometric identification systems and approaches have some limitations such as noisy data, inter and intra class variations, high time cost, inaccurate, non-universality and spoofing attack. This paper proposes a new anti-spoof multispectral biometric cloud-based identification approach for privacy and security of cloud computing. The approach offers the solution using multi-spectral palmprint as a typical biometric trait between two main phases: offline enrollment phase and online identification phase. This work is considered the first approach of privacy-preservation in cloud computing using encrypted multi-spectral palmprint features without any information leakage and disclosure possibility. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can accurately and efficiently provide the privacy and security of cloud data. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Three discriminative representations for face presentation attack detection are introduced in this paper. Firstly we design a descriptor called spatial pyramid coding micro-texture (SPMT) feature to characterize local appearance information. Secondly we utilize the SSD, which is a deep learning framework for detection, to excavate context cues and conduct end-to-end face presentation attack detection. Finally we design a descriptor called template face matched binocular depth (TFBD) feature to characterize stereo structures of real and fake faces. For accurate presentation attack detection, we also design two kinds of representation combinations. Firstly, we propose a decision-level cascade strategy to combine SPMT with SSD. Secondly, we use a simple score fusion strategy to combine face structure cues (TFBD) with local micro-texture features (SPMT). To demonstrate the effectiveness of our design, we evaluate the representation combination of SPMT and SSD on three public datasets, which outperforms all other state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we evaluate the representation combination of SPMT and TFBD on our dataset and excellent performance is also achieved. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB Many prior face anti-spoofing works develop discriminative models for recognizing the subtle differences between live and spoof faces. Those approaches often regard the image as an indivisible unit, and process it holistically, without explicit modeling of the spoofing process. In this work, motivated by the noise modeling and denoising algorithms, we identify a new problem of face de-spoofing, for the purpose of anti-spoofing: inversely decomposing a spoof face into a spoof noise and a live face, and then utilizing the spoof noise for classification. A CNN architecture with proper constraints and supervisions is proposed to overcome the problem of having no ground truth for the decomposition. We evaluate the proposed method on multiple face anti-spoofing databases. The results show promising improvements due to our spoof noise modeling. Moreover, the estimated spoof noise provides a visualization which helps to understand the added spoof noise by each spoof medium. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.

AB In the last 57 years, face biometrie researchers have achieved many successes. Face recognition systems have been extensively used in government as well as commercial applications such as mobile, banking and surveillance systems etc. In the last 10 years, the whole biometric community such as researchers, developers, and retailers have worked on challenging tasks to develop a more accurate protection method against spoofing threats. The face spoofing attacks affect high-security field in the companies, government sectors, rising small and medium sized endeavors. Although several face antispoofing or liveness detection methods have been proposed, the issue is still unresolved due to difficulty in finding the features and methods for spoof attacks. Recently it has been shown that the traditional face biometric techniques are more vulnerable to spoofing attacks, so entire research community required to concentrate more to resolve solutions against spoofing attacks. The goal of this paper is to provide a detailed study of antispoofing methodologies and evaluation of databases. The study concluded that there is a need to provide more generalized algorithms for detection of unpredictable spoofing attacks in order to make the system more secure, computationally efficient and reliable. © 2017 IEEE.

AB The human face is an important biometric quantity which can be used to access a user-based system. As human face images can easily be obtained via mobile cameras and social networks, user-based access systems should be robust against spoof face attacks. In other words, a reliable face-based access system can determine both the identity and the liveness of the input face. To this end, various feature-based spoof face detection methods have been proposed. These methods generally apply a series of processes against the input image(s) in order to detect the liveness of the face. In this paper, a deep-learning-based spoof face detection is proposed. Two different deep learning models are used to achieve this, namely local receptive fields (LRF)-ELM and CNN. LRF-ELM is a recently developed model which contains a convolution and a pooling layer before a fully connected layer that makes the model fast. CNN, however, contains a series of convolution and pooling layers. In addition, the CNN model may have more fully connected layers. A series of experiments were conducted on two popular spoof face detection databases, namely NUAA and CASIA. The obtained results were then compared, and the LRF-ELM method yielded better results against both databases. © 2017 IEEE.

AB Non-reference image quality measures are used to distinguish real biometric data from data as used in presentation / sensor spoofing attacks. An experimental study shows that based on a set of 6 such measures, classification of real vs. fake iris, fingerprint, and face data is feasible with an accuracy of 90% on average. However, we have found that the best quality measure (combination) and classification setting highly depends on the target dataset. Thus, we are unable to provide any other recommendation than to optimise the choice of quality measure and classification setting for each specific application setting. © 2017 IEEE.

AB For applications such as airport border control, biometric technologies that can process many capture subjects quickly, efficiently, with weak supervision, and with minimal discomfort are desirable. Facial recognition is particularly appealing because it is minimally invasive yet offers relatively good recognition performance. Unfortunately, the combination of weak supervision and minimal invasiveness makes even highly accurate facial recognition systems susceptible to spoofing via presentation attacks. Thus, there is great demand for an effective and low cost system capable of rejecting such attacks. To this end we introduce PARAPH - a novel hardware extension that exploits different measurements of light polarization to yield an image space in which presentation media are readily discernible from Bona Fide facial characteristics. The PARAPH system is inexpensive with an added cost of less than 10 US dollars. The system makes two polarization measurements in rapid succession, allowing them to be approximately pixel-aligned, with a frame rate limited by the camera, not the system. There are no moving parts above the molecular level, due to the efficient use of twisted nematic liquid crystals. We present evaluation images using three presentation attack media next to an actual face - high quality photos on glossy and matte paper and a video of the face on an LCD. In each case, the actual face in the image generated by PARAPH is structurally discernible from the presentations, which appear either as noise (print attacks) or saturated images (replay attacks). © 2016 IEEE.

AB Objectives: Pituitary incidentalomas (PI) are frequently found on brain imaging. Despite their high prevalence, little is known about their long-term natural history and there are limited guidelines on how to monitor them. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study to compare epidemiological characteristics at presentation and the natural history of PI in population-based vs referral-based registries from two tertiary-care referral centers in Canada. Results: A total of 328 patients with PI were included, of whom 73% had pituitary adenomas (PA) and 27% had non-pituitary sellar masses. The commonest indications for imaging were headache (28%), dizziness (12%) and stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) (9%). There was a slight female preponderance (52%) with a median age of 55 years at diagnosis; 71% presented as macroadenomas (>10 mm). Of PA, 25% were functioning tumors and at presentation 36% of patients had evidence of secondary hormonal deficiency (SHD). Of the total cohort, 68% were treated medically or conservatively whereas 32% required surgery. Most tumors (87% in non-surgery and 68% in post-surgery group) remained stable during follow-up. Similarly, 84% of patients in the non-surgery and 73% in the surgery group did not develop additional SHD during follow-up. The diagnosis of non-functioning adenoma was a risk factor for tumor enlargement and a change in SHD status was associated with a change in tumor size. Conclusions: Our data suggest that most PI seen in tertiary-care referral centers present as macroadenomas and may frequently be functional, often requiring medical or surgical intervention. © 2016 European Society of Endocrinology.

AB Background: Asthma is a common chronic condition. Work-related asthma (WRA) has a large socioeconomic impact and is increasing in prevalence but remains under-recognized. Although international guidelines recommend patient education, no widely available educational tool exists. Objective: To develop a WRA educational website for adults with asthma. Methods: An evidence-based database for website content was developed, which applied evidence-based website design principles to create a website prototype. This was subsequently tested and serially revised according to patient feedback in three moderated phases (one focus group and two interview phases), followed by face validation by asthma educators. Results : Patients (n=10) were 20 to 28 years of age; seven (70%) were female, three (30%) were in university, two (20%) were in college and five (50%) were currently employed. Key format preferences included: wellspaced, bulleted text; movies (as opposed to animations); photos (as opposed to cartoons); an explicit listing of website aims on the home page; and an exploding tab structure. Participants disliked integrated games and knowledge quizzes. Desired informational content included a list of triggers, prevention/control methods, currently available tools and resources, a self-test for WRA, real-life scenario presentations, compensation information, information for colleagues on how to react during an asthma attack and a WRA discussion forum. Conclusions: The website met the perceived needs of young asthmatic patients. This resource could be disseminated widely and should be tested for its effects on patient behaviour, including job choice, workplace irritant/allergen avoidance and/or protective equipment, asthma medication use and physician prompting for management of WRA symptoms. ©2013 Pulsus Group Inc.

AB Brain signals have been investigated within the medical field for more than a century to study brain diseases like epilepsy, spinal cord injuries, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, schizophrenia, and stroke among others. They are also used in both brain computer and brain machine interface systems with assistance, rehabilitative, and entertainment applications. Despite the broad interest in clinical applications, the use of brain signals has been only recently investigated by the scientific community as a biometric characteristic to be used in automatic people recognition systems. However, brain signals present some peculiarities, not shared by the most commonly used biometrics, such as face, iris, and fingerprints, with reference to privacy compliance, robustness against spoofing attacks, possibility to perform continuous identification, intrinsic liveness detection, and universality. These peculiarities make the use of brain signals appealing. On the other hand, there are many challenges which need to be properly addressed. The understanding of the level of uniqueness and permanence of brain responses, the design of elicitation protocols, and the invasiveness of the acquisition process are only few of the challenges which need to be tackled. In this paper, we further speculate on those issues, which represent an obstacle toward the deployment of biometric systems based on the analysis of brain activity in real life applications and intend to provide a critical and comprehensive review of state-of-the-art methods for electroencephalogram-based automatic user recognition, also reporting neurophysiological evidences related to the performed claims. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB Hereditary angio-oedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency (HAE-C1-INH) is a rare inherited disorder characterised by recurring and debilitating episodes of cutaneous swelling and abdominal pain and less frequent episodes of laryngeal oedema. Symptom onset is usually in childhood and early adolescence, with earlier disease onset associated with greater disease severity. Although HAE-C1-INH attacks are generally less frequent and less severe in children than in adults, they can cause significant physical and psychological impairment and affect advancement in school. There are often significant delays in the diagnosis of HAE-C1-INH due to its variable clinical presentation and because abdominal symptoms can often mimic other common paediatric gastrointestinal disorders. In recent years, several disease-specific agents have become available for the acute and prophylactic treatment of HAE-C1-INH. Although these treatments have not been evaluated rigorously in controlled clinical trials in children with HAE-C1-INH, paediatric data on efficacy and safety are available for some agents. Early diagnosis and initiation of appropriate therapy in children with HAE-C1-INH can help reduce the burden of this illness in the paediatric population. © 2011 SEICAP.

AB Biometric identification systems, i.e. the systems that are able to recognize humans by analyzing their physiological or behavioral characteristics, have gained a lot of interest in recent years. They can be used to raise the security level in certain institutions or can be treated as a convenient replacement for PINs and passwords for regular users. Automatic face recognition is one of the most popular biometric technologies, widely used even by many low-end consumer devices such as netbooks. However, even the most accurate face identification algorithm would be useless if it could be cheated by presenting a photograph of a person instead of the real face. Therefore, the proper liveness measurement is extremely important. In this paper we present a method that differentiates between video sequences showing real persons and their photographs. First we calculate the optical flow of the face region using the Farnebäck algorithm. Then we convert the motion information into images and perform the initial data selection. Finally, we apply the Support Vector Machine to distinguish between real faces and photographs. The experimental results confirm that the proposed approach could be successfully applied in practice. © 2012 Polish Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: Medial canthal degloving injury causes a spectrum of damage to the soft tissues of the nasoorbitoethmoid complex. The authors present a case series of medial canthal degloving injuries and discuss clinical findings and treatment options. METHODS: The medical records of nine patients who presented to the University of California, San Diego Ophthalmic Plastic Service with medial canthal degloving injuries between 1999 and 2010 were reviewed retrospectively. Data collected included type and duration of injury, clinical findings, surgical procedures, and duration of follow-up. RESULTS: Nine patients (seven males and two females) were examined and treated from 1999 to 2010. Average age at the time of presentation was 33.3 years (range, 12 to 68 years). Causes of injury included motor vehicle accident (six patients), bicycle accident (one patient), dog bite (one patient), and bear attack (one patient). Average duration of injury before presentation to the authors' clinic was 4.4 years (range, 2 months to 20 years). Average follow-up was 32 months (range, 6 to 110 months). Common findings in these patients included a laceration extending from the forehead or eyebrow region across the medial canthus, telecanthus, eyelid ptosis, and canalicular injury. CONCLUSIONS: Medial canthal degloving injuries typically result in characteristic findings of vertically oriented laceration traversing the medial canthus, telecanthus, ptosis, and injury to the lacrimal outflow system. Reconstruction should be performed in a staged fashion, first addressing telecanthus and lacrimal system repair. Ptosis repair is performed as a second-stage procedure. Adherence to specific surgical principles leads to satisfactory functional and cosmetic results. Copyright © 2011 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.

AB In general, a typical iris recognition system includes iris imaging, iris liveness detection, iris image quality assessment, and iris recognition. This paper presents an algorithm focusing on the last two steps. The novelty of this algorithm includes improving the speed and accuracy of the iris segmentation process, assessing the iris image quality such that only the clear images are accepted so as to reduce the recognition error, and producing a feature vector with discriminating texture features and a proper dimensionality so as to improve the recognition accuracy and computational efficiency. The Hough transform, polynomial fitting technique, and some morphological operations are used for the segmentation process. The phase data from 1D Log-Gabor filter is extracted and encoded efficiently to produce a proper feature vector. Experimental tests were performed using CASIA iris database (756 samples). These tests prove that the proposed algorithm has an encouraging performance. ©2010 IEEE.

AB Background: Immunofluorescence findings in granuloma faciale have been infrequently described. Reported findings include granular IgA, IgG, IgM, and C3 deposits in the dermoepidermal junction, in blood vessel walls, and on connective tissue fibers; IgG in the basement membrane zone, and IgG around blood vessels. Observations: We report two cases ofgranuloma faciale in which biopsy specimens were sent for routine pathology as well as immunofluorescence. Additional work-up included serologic testing for markers of lupus erythematosus (LE). Immunofluorescence in both cases revealed granular IgA, IgG, IgM, C3, and C5-9 deposits along the dermoepidermal junction only. Blood vessel walls and connective tissue fibers were spared. Serologic studies for markers of LE were negative. Conclusion: Immunofluorescence findings were essentially identical to those which would be expected in cutaneous LE; however, the combination of negative serologic studies for LE, histopathologic findings typical of granuloma faciale, and clinical findings most consistent with granuloma faciale allowed the diagnosis of granuloma faciale to be rendered with certainty. Interpretation of results of direct immunofluorescence of skin should be correlated with clinical presentation, histopathological findings and other laboratory results in order to render final diagnosis of a given patient. © Blackwell Munksgaard 2003.

AB Research in the area of automatic speaker verification (ASV) has advanced enough for the industry to start using ASV systems in practical applications. However, these systems are highly vulnerable to spoofing or presentation attacks(PAs), limiting their wide deployment. Several speech-based presentation attack detection (PAD) methods have been proposed recently but most of them are based on hand crafted frequency or phase-based features. Although convolutional neural networks (CNN) have already shown breakthrough results in face recognition, little is understood whether CNNs are as effective in detecting presentation attacks in speech. In this paper, to investigate the applicability of CNNs for PAD, we consider shallow and deep examples of CNN architectures implemented using Tensorflow and compare their performances with the state of the art MFCC with GMM-based system on two large databases with presentation attacks: publicly available voicePA and proprietary BioCPqD-PA. We study the impact of increasing the depth of CNNs on the performance, and note how they perform on unknown attacks, by using one database to train and another to evaluate. The results demonstrate that CNNs are able to learn a database significantly better (increasing depth also improves the performance), compared to hand crafted features. However, CNN-based PADs still lack the ability to generalize across databases and are unable to detect unknown attacks well. © 2018 IEEE.

AB 3D mask spoofing attack has been one of the main challenges in face recognition. A real face displays a different motion behaviour compared to a 3D mask spoof attempt, which is reflected by different facial dynamic textures. However, the different dynamic information usually exists in the subtle texture level, which cannot be fully differentiated by traditional hand-crafted texture-based methods. In this paper, we propose a novel method for 3D mask face anti-spoofing, namely deep convolutional dynamic texture learning, which learns robust dynamic texture information from fine-grained deep convolutional features. Moreover, channel-discriminability constraint is adaptively incorporated to weight the discriminability of feature channels in the learning process. Experiments on both public datasets validate that the proposed method achieves promising results under intra and cross dataset scenario. © 2017 IEEE.

AB Face recognition systems have been widely adopted for user authentication in security systems due to their simplicity and effectiveness. However, spoofing attacks, including printed photos, displayed photos, and replayed video attacks, are critical challenges to authentication, and these spoofing attacks allow malicious invaders to gain access to the system. This paper proposes two novel features for face liveness detection systems to protect against printed photo attacks and replayed attacks for biometric authentication systems. The first feature obtains the texture difference between red and green channels of face images inspired by the observation that skin blood flow in the face has properties that enable distinction between live and spoofing face images. The second feature estimates the color distribution in the local regions of face images, instead of whole images, because image quality might be more discriminative in small areas of face images. These two features are concatenated together, along with a multi-scale local binary pattern feature, and a support vector machine classifier is trained to discriminate between live and spoofing face images. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method for face spoof detection is promising when compared with that of previously published methods. Furthermore, the proposed system can be implemented in real time, which is valuable for mobile applications. © 2017 by the authors.

AB In this work, we focused on liveness detection for facial recognition system's spoofing via fake face movement. We have developed a pupil direction observing system for anti-spoofing in face recognition systems using a basic hardware equipment. Firstly, eye area is being extracted from real time camera by using Haar-Cascade Classifier with specially trained classifier for eye region detection. Feature points have extracted and traced for minimizing person's head movements and getting stable eye region by using Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) algorithm. Eye area is being cropped from real time camera frame and rotated for a stable eye area. Pupils are extracted from eye area by using a new improved algorithm subsequently. After a few stable number of frames that has pupils, proposed spoofing algorithm selects a random direction and sends a signal to Arduino to activate that selected direction's LED on a square frame that has totally eight LEDs for each direction. After chosen LED has been activated, eye direction is observed whether pupil direction and LED's position matches. If the compliance requirement is satisfied, algorithm returns data that contains liveness information. Complete algorithm for liveness detection using pupil tracking is tested on volunteers and algorithm achieved high success ratio. © 2017 IEEE.

AB Recently, automatic face recognition has been applied in many web and mobile applications. Developers integrate and implement face recognition as an access control into these applications. However, face recognition authentication is vulnerable to several attacks especially when an attacker presents a 2-D printed image or recorded video frames in front of the face sensor system to gain access as a legitimate user. This paper introduces a non-intrusive method to detect face spoofing attacks that utilize a single frame of sequenced frames. We propose a specialized deep convolution neural network to extract complex and high features of the input diffused frame. We tested our method on the Replay Attack dataset which consists of 1200 short videos of both real-access and spoofing attacks. An extensive experimental analysis was conducted that demonstrated better results when compared to previous static algorithms results. © 2016 IEEE.

AB To ensure the actual presence of a real legitimate trait in contrast to a fake self-manufactured synthetic or reconstructed sample is a significant problem in biometric authentication, which requires the development of new and efficient protection measures. In this paper, we present a novel software-based fake detection method that can be used in multiple biometric systems to detect different types of fraudulent access attempts. The objective of the proposed system is to enhance the security of biometric recognition frameworks, by adding liveness assessment in a fast, user-friendly, and non-intrusive manner, through the use of image quality assessment. The proposed approach presents a very low degree of complexity, which makes it suitable for real-time applications, using 25 general image quality features extracted from one image (i.e., the same acquired for authentication purposes) to distinguish between legitimate and impostor samples. The experimental results, obtained on publicly available data sets of fingerprint, iris, and 2D face, show that the proposed method is highly competitive compared with other state-of-the-art approaches and that the analysis of the general image quality of real biometric samples reveals highly valuable information that may be very efficiently used to discriminate them from fake traits. © 1992-2012 IEEE.

AB BACKGROUND: Paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD) is a rare disorder characterized by episodic hyperkinetic movement attacks. We have recently identified mutations in the MR-1 gene causing familial PNKD. METHODS: We reviewed the clinical features of 14 kindreds with familial dyskinesia that was not clearly induced by movement or during sleep. Of these 14 kindreds, 8 had MR-1 mutations and 6 did not. RESULTS: Patients with PNKD with MR-1 mutations had their attack onset in youth (infancy and early childhood). Typical attacks consisted of a mixture of chorea and dystonia in the limbs, face, and trunk, and typical attack duration lasted from 10 minutes to 1 hour. Caffeine, alcohol, and emotional stress were prominent precipitants. Attacks had a favorable response to benzodiazepines, such as clonazepam and diazepam. Attacks in families without MR-1 mutations were more variable in their age at onset, precipitants, clinical features, and response to medications. Several were induced by persistent exercise. CONCLUSIONS: Paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD) should be strictly defined based on age at onset and ability to precipitate attacks with caffeine and alcohol. Patients with this clinical presentation (which is similar to the phenotype initially reported by Mount and Reback) are likely to harbor myofibrillogenesis regulator 1 (MR-1) gene mutations. Other "PNKD-like" families exist, but atypical features suggests that these subjects are clinically distinct from PNKD and do not have MR-1 mutations. Some may represent paroxysmal exertional dyskinesia. ©2007AAN Enterprises, Inc.

AB The increasing interest in the evaluation of biometric systems security is an important issue to be considered. The different threats called direct or spoofing attacks where in these attacks, the intruder uses some type of synthetically produced artifact (e.g., gummy finger, printed iris image or face mask), or tries to mimic the behavior of the genuine user , to fraudulent access of the biometric system have motivated to new efficient protection measures. In this paper, we present a novel software-based fake biometric detection method that can be used in multiple biometric systems to detect different types of fraudulent access attempts. The use of image quality assessment for liveness detection is motivated by the assumption that: It is expected that a fake image captured in an attack attempt will have different quality than a real sample acquired in the normal operation scenario for which the sensor was designed. The proposed approach presents a very low degree of complexity, which makes it suitable for real-Time applications, using general image quality features extracted from one image to differentiate between real and fake samples. This proposed work enhances the security of biometric recognitions, by using the liveness detection through image quality assessment and by fusion of multiple biometric traits. The SVM classifier is used for differentiating between the real and fake samples.

AB Face recognition is one of the most socially accepted forms of biometric recognition. The recent availability of very accurate and efficient face recognition algorithms leaves the vulnerability to presentation attacks as the major challenge to face recognition solutions. Previous works have shown high preforming presentation attack detection PAD solutions under controlled evaluation scenarios. This work tried to analyze the practical use of PAD by investigating the more realistic scenario of cross-database evaluation and presenting a state-of-the-art performance comparison. The work also investigated the relation between the video duration and the PAD performance. This is done along with presenting an optical flow based approach that proves to outperform state-of-the-art solutions in most experiment settings. © 2016.

AB This review on hereditary angioedema (HAE) focused on special topics regarding HAE in children, women of childbearing age, and the elderly. HAE is a rare autosomal dominant bradykinin-mediated disorder characterized by recurrent attacks of subcutaneous or submucosal swelling that usually affects the face, upper airway, extremities, gastrointestinal tract, or genitalia. These recurrent attacks cause significant morbidity and can be life threatening, especially when the swelling affects the airway. Our objective was to summarize the published data available on the disease epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, on demand and prophylactic therapy, and focus on management considerations for these special patient populations. Unique aspects of HAE in women with regard to contraception, hormone replacement therapy, pregnancy, lactation, and menopause were also reviewed. © 2015, OceanSide Publications, Inc., U.S.A.

AB Emotional states influence whole-body movements during quiet standing, gait initiation, and steady state gait. A notable gap exists, however, in understanding how emotions affect postural changes during the period preceding the execution of planned whole-body movements. The impact of emotion-induced postural reactions on forthcoming posturomotor movements remains unknown. We sought to determine the influence of emotional reactions on center of pressure (COP) displacement before the initiation of forward gait. Participants (N = 23, 14 females) stood on a force plate and initiated forward gait at the offset of an emotional image (representing five discrete categories: attack, sad faces, erotica, happy faces, and neutral objects). COP displacement in the anteroposterior direction was quantified for a 2 second period during image presentation. Following picture onset, participants produced a posterior postural response to all image types. The greatest posterior displacement was occasioned in response to attack or threat stimuli compared with happy faces and erotica images. Results suggest the impact of emotional states on gait behavior begins during the motor planning period before the preparatory phase of gait initiation, and manifests in center of pressure displacement alterations. © 2015 Human Kinetics, Inc.

AB Face liveness detection is more and more important in face recognition systems, which are vulnerable to spoof attacks made by non-real faces. Recent work has revealed that some algorithms based on image descriptors are applied to face liveness detection against face spoofing attacks, such as LBP and LBP-TOP. However, these image descriptors are not robust to spoofing attacks. In this paper, we propose a robust and powerful local descriptor, called WLD-TOP. It combines temporal and spatial information into a single descriptor with a multiresolution strategy. Extensive experiments on CASIA and our new SYSU-MFSD database demonstrate that the descriptor can achieve a better liveness detection performance in both intra and cross-databases compared to the state-of-the-art techniques based on descriptors. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB It has been suggested that the impact of emotional expressions on the startle reflex is influenced by the intention communicated by the expression (e.g., the intention to attack). However, we propose that the meaning of an emotional expression is not only based on the intention, but is also influenced by characteristics of the expresser such as gender: since men are typically seen as more dominant than women, anger expressed by men should be perceived as particularly threatening, thus amplifying the startle response. We compared the influence of anger, fear and neutral expressions shown by men and women on the startle reaction. Startle reactions were measured using electromyography. As predicted, we found stronger startle reactions after the presentation of anger expressed by men compared to fearful and neutral expressions shown by men. For female expressers, the startle response was not affected by expression type. © 2014, Taylor & Francis.

AB Spoofing attack (or copy attack) is a fatal threat for biometric authentication systems. In this paper, we present a novel liveness detection method based on frequency entropy of image sequences against the photograph spoofing. By splitting the color video of face region into RGB channels, we can obtain the time sequences of each color channel. Then, three RGB sequences are analyzed through Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithm to eliminate the cross-channel image noises. Moreover, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is further applied to these signals to get the power spectra of each RGB channels. Finally, the power spectra are verified through the entropy calculation to validate the liveness or photo attack. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, which has an accuracy of more than 95%. © 2013 IEEE.

AB Reactive computer systems bear inherent complexity due to continuous interactions with their environment. While this environment often proves to be uncontrollable, we still want to ensure that critical computer systems will not fail, no matter what they face. Examples are legion: railway traffic, power plants, plane navigation systems, etc. Formal verification of a system may ensure that it satisfies a given specification, but only applies to an already existing model of a system. In this work, we address the problem of synthesis: starting from a specification of the desired behavior, we show how to build a suitable system controller that will enforce this specification. In particular, we discuss recent developments of that approach for systems that must ensure Boolean behaviors (e.g., reachability, liveness) along with quantitative requirements over their execution (e.g., never drop out of fuel, ensure a suitable mean response time). We notably illustrate a powerful, practically usable algorithm for the automated synthesis of provably safe reactive systems. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013.

AB Background: Ectopic biliary drainage is a rare congenital anomaly on which we have scarce data in the current literature.Methods: The data were collected from the records of 400 endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP). In this report, we present 10 cases (male/female: 9/1, mean age 54 years, range 38-74) with ectopic biliary openings into the duodenum and/or stomach diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP).Results: In our series, the frequency of ectopic biliary drainage is 2% (10 out of 400 ERCPs). Recurrent attacks of cholangitis and complicated ulcer formation in the distal stomach and bulbar duodenum were the most common signs in the present series. The sites of ectopic biliary drainage were the stomach in 1 case, the duodenum bulbus in 7 cases and the postbulbar duodenum in 2 cases. Bulbar ulcer, deformed pylorus and bulbus were present in 7 cases, apical bulbar stricture in 2, gastric ulcer in 1, pyloroplasty and/or gastroenterostomy in 3 cases. One case had had previous bleeding episode. Some of them had undergone previous surgeries for gall-stone disease (cholecystectomy in 5 cases, bile duct operation in 3 cases) and ulcer complications (pyloroplasty/gastroenterostomy in 3 cases). ERCP revealed dilatation of the biliary tree and hook shaped distal choledochus in all cases, choledocholithiasis in 7 and Mirizzi syndrome in 1. Endoscopic balloon dilatations for gastric outlet obstruction, extraction of bile stones after balloon dilating the ectopic site, surgery for difficult cases with large bile duct stones or with gastric outlet obstruction were preferred methods in this series of patients.Conclusion: With this report, we have to remind that ectopic biliary drainage must be considered in the differential diagnosis when the clinician faces cases with gastric outlet obstruction due to peptic ulcer formation accompanied by cholangitis/cholestasis. © 2010 Saritas et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB Introduction. Noma, aptly named the 'face of poverty', is a scourge with a mortality rate of up to 90% that affects some 140,000 people each year, predominantly children in the sub-Saharan 'noma belt'. Survivors of the acute attack suffer severe facial disfigurement from loss of facial tissue and scarring. Surgical reconstruction of noma defects is a major challenge, especially in Africa, where the majority of cases occur. Case presentation. We report the case of a 40-year-old Somali man who presented with severe facial disfigurement, including total absence of both upper and lower lips. After a failed initial reconstruction, a combination of platysma flaps and a left deltopectoral flap provided mucosal lining, while a scalp visor flap served to recreate upper and lower lips, the beard and moustache. Conclusion. The scalp visor flap offers a simple but extremely versatile tool for use in midfacial reconstruction, especially in the male, providing neo-lip tissue, a moustache and a beard. This is the first report of a simultaneous total upper and lower lip reconstruction using a scalp visor flap, in the English literature. We also emphasize on a process of transfer of skills to enable local surgeons to effectively manage the challenge that noma presents. © 2009 licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB Spoofing is the act of masquerading as a valid user by falsifying data to gain an illegitimate access. Vulnerability of recognition systems to spoofing attacks (presentation attacks) is still an open security issue in biometrics domain and among all biometric traits, face is exposed to the most serious threat, since it is particularly easy to access and reproduce. In this paper, many different types of face spoofing attacks have been examined and various algorithms have been proposed to detect them. Mainly focusing on 2D attacks forged by displaying printed photos or replaying recorded videos on mobile devices, a significant portion of these studies ground their arguments on the flatness of the spoofing material in front of the sensor. However, with the advancements in 3D reconstruction and printing technologies, this assumption can no longer be maintained. In this paper, we aim to inspect the spoofing potential of subject-specific 3D facial masks for different recognition systems and address the detection problem of this more complex attack type. In order to assess the spoofing performance of 3D masks against 2D, 2.5D, and 3D face recognition and to analyze various texture-based countermeasures using both 2D and 2.5D data, a parallel study with comprehensive experiments is performed on two data sets: the Morpho database which is not publicly available and the newly distributed 3D mask attack database. © 2014 IEEE.

AB In 5-10% of cases of brucellosis may lead to central nervous system manifestation presenting most often as a meningitis or meningoencephalitis. We report three neurobrucellosis who have different presentation. First patient; a 49-year-old-woman who developed diffuse cerebral white matter lesions as leukoencephalopathy associated with neurobrucellosis, presented with gait disturbance, behavior change and seizure. Second patient; 44-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a complaint of progressive motor weakness in his bilateral legs for four months and headache for one year. The patient's symptoms may be explained with myeloradiculopathy and meningoencephalitis but the clinical picture didn't correlate with imaging findings. Third patient; 23-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a complaint of transient numbness attacks in his left of face and hand and headache for twenty days. He presented as meningitis which is the most clinical presentation of neurobrucellosis and meningovascular complications. Conclusively, brucellosis is still endemic in Turkey and thus neurobrucellosis should be considered in the unexplained neurological symptoms such as cognitive dysfunction, young transient ischemic attacks, paraparesis and psychiatric symptoms.

AB Following the September 11 terrorist attacks, the vulnerability of the United States became apparent. It also became evident that there was a need for respiratory protection. The purpose of this study was to determine the prior knowledge and perceptions of emergency medical technicians with respect to bioterrorism and to enhance their current knowledge to better prepare them for possible future events. The study was also designed to create a certified pool of trainers who would be capable of fit-testing all squad members with N-100 respirators. Representatives were recruited from each of the Hunterdon County, New Jersey, rescue squads. Participants attended a train-the-trainer session. Before the session and after, they were tested on knowledge and perceptions about relevant bioterrorism issues and were given an educational presentation on bioterrorism, threatening agents, respiratory health, and proper protection, along with being introduced to the fit-test steps for N-100 respirator masks. The response rate for the training was 94 percent. The authors measured and compared responses on the pre-test and the post-test with respect to knowledge, behaviors, and perceptions, and the results indicated a change following the training. The study thus provided evidence that the train-the-trainer program is an effective method of providing public health preparedness training to members of community organizations and agencies.

AB In this paper we propose a feature level fusion approach for checking liveness in face-voice person authentication. Liveness verification experiments conducted on two audiovisual databases, VidTIMIT and UCBN, show that feature-level fusion is indeed a powerful technique for checking liveness in systems that are vulnerable to replay attacks, as it preserves synchronisation between closely coupled modalities, such as voice and face, through various stages of authentication. An improvement in error rate of the order of 25-40% is achieved for replay attack experiments by using feature level fusion of acoustic and visual feature vectors from lip region as compared to classical late fusion approach. © 2005 IEEE.

AB The increasing demand on enhanced security has led to an unprecedented interest in automated personal identification based on biometrics. Among the various biometric identification methods, iris recognition is widely regarded as the most reliable and is one of the most active research topics in biometrics. Significant progress has been made since the concept of automated iris recognition was first proposed in 1987, not only in research and algorithm development but also in commercial exploitation and practical applications. This paper provides an overview on recent progress in iris recognition and discusses some of the remaining challenges and possible future work in this exciting field.

TI ERS statement on tracheomalacia and bronchomalacia in children
SO The European respiratory journal
LA English
DT JOUR
AB Tracheomalacia and tracheobronchomalacia may be primary abnormalities of the large airways or associated with a wide variety of congenital and acquired conditions. The evidence on diagnosis, classification and management is scant. There is no universally accepted classification of severity. Clinical presentation includes early-onset stridor or fixed wheeze, recurrent infections, brassy cough and even near-death attacks, depending on the site and severity of the lesion. Diagnosis is usually made by flexible bronchoscopy in a free-breathing child but may also be shown by other dynamic imaging techniques such as low-contrast volume bronchography, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Lung function testing can provide supportive evidence but is not diagnostic. Management may be medical or surgical, depending on the nature and severity of the lesions, but the evidence base for any therapy is limited. While medical options that include bronchodilators, anti-muscarinic agents, mucolytics and antibiotics (as well as treatment of comorbidities and associated conditions) are used, there is currently little evidence for benefit. Chest physiotherapy is commonly prescribed, but the evidence base is poor. When symptoms are severe, surgical options include aortopexy or posterior tracheopexy, tracheal resection of short affected segments, internal stents and external airway splinting. If respiratory support is needed, continuous positive airway pressure is the most commonly used modality either via a face mask or tracheostomy. Parents of children with tracheobronchomalacia report diagnostic delays and anxieties about how to manage their child's condition, and want more information. There is a need for more research to establish an evidence base for malacia. This European Respiratory Society statement provides a review of the current literature to inform future study.

AB Anti-spoof touchless imaging of human ear has strong potential to be a useful alternative to traditional biometric sensors. The features in a human ear are more reliable than other physical traits like fingerprint, face, palm print, etc. In this paper, we propose an efficient ear pattern sensor by introducing a new imaging technique that is capable of simultaneous retrieval of the topographic details as well as its liveliness information. In the proposed technique, a collimated laser beam is made incident on a sinusoidal grating, and the resultant structured pattern is projected towards the ear specimen. For detection of topographic information and liveliness, time series bio-speckled fringe sequences are recorded using a CCD camera. For noise removal and shape reconstruction from the acquired information, a combination of windowed Fourier filtering and low pass filtering is used. Discrete cosine transform based fast biospeckle algorithm is introduced for assessment of genuineness (i.e. to create distinction between real and fake samples) of the specimen. The proposed sensor is simple, compact, full-field and robust against different spoof attacks. © 2018

AB With advancements in technology, it is now possible to create representations of human faces in a seamless manner for fake media, leveraging the large-scale availability of videos. These fake faces can be used to conduct personation attacks on the targeted subjects. Availability of open source software and a variety of commercial applications provides an opportunity to generate fake videos of a particular target subject in a number of ways. In this article, we evaluate the generalizability of the fake face detection methods through a series of studies to benchmark the detection accuracy. To this extent, we have collected a new database of more than 53,000 images, from 150 videos, originating from multiple sources of digitally generated fakes including Computer Graphics Image (CGI) generation and many tampering based approaches. In addition, we have also included images (with more than 3,200) from the predominantly used Swap-Face application that is commonly available on smartphones. Extensive experiments are carried out using both texture-based handcrafted detection methods and deep learning based detection methods to find the suitability of detection methods. Through the set of evaluation, we attempt to answer if the current fake face detection methods can be generalizable. © 2018 Gesellschaft fuer Informatik.

TI Hereditary angio-oedema in the western Cape province, South Africa

AB Background. Hereditary angio-oedema (HAE) is an autosomal dominant condition caused by a deficiency in the C1-esterase inhibitor protein, resulting in increased bradykinin release. It presents clinically with recurrent attacks of angio-oedema, commonly affecting the limbs, face, upper airway and gastrointestinal tract. Little is known about this condition in sub-Saharan Africa. Objectives. To analyse and report on the clinical presentation and treatment of patients with HAE in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. Methods. A retrospective analysis was conducted on a series of 60 cases of HAE seen between 2010 and 2015 at the Allergy Diagnostic and Clinical Research Unit, University of Cape Town Lung Institute, and the Allergy Clinic at Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town. The findings in 43 cases of type 1 HAE are described. Parameters assessed included age, gender, age of diagnosis, duration of illness, family history, identifiable triggers, average duration of attack, number of attacks per year and type of attack. Results. A total of 43 patients were included in this study. Of these, 65.1% (28/43) were female. The median age at diagnosis was 20 years (interquartile range (IQR) 10 - 27) and the median duration of illness 10.5 years (IQR 6 - 22). Of the patients, 62.8% (27/43), 32.6% (14/43) and 4.7% (2/43) were of mixed ancestry, white and black African, respectively; 51.2% (22/43) were index cases, with the remaining 48.8% (21/43) diagnoses via family member screening, 12 families making up the majority of the cohort. The mean (standard deviation) duration of an acute attack was 49 (25.8) hours, and 64.3% (27/42), 71.4% (30/42), 14.3% (6/42) and 88.1% (37/42) of patients experienced facial or upper airway, abdominal, external genitalia and limb attacks, respectively. Danazol for long-term prophylaxis was used in 21 patients, while C1-inhibitor concentrate (Berinert) was accessed for short-term prophylaxis in only four patients. Acute life-threating attacks were treated with fresh frozen plasma in 11 patients, and only four accessed icatibant. The mortality rate for the period 2010 - 2015 was 4.5% (2/43). The prevalence of HAE in the Western Cape was estimated to be 1:140 000. Conclusions. HAE occurs in South Africans of all ethnicities, and life-threatening attacks occur in almost two-thirds of patients. Despite limited therapeutic options and very limited access to gold-standard therapies available in the developed world, our mortality rate is very low, with both the deaths related to inability to access emergency treatment rapidly. © 2018, South African Medical Association.

AB Face authentication has been widely available on smartphones, tablets, and laptops. As numerous personal images are published in online social networks (OSNs), OSN-based facial disclosure (OSNFD) creates significant threat against face authentication. We make the first attempt to quantitatively measure OSNFD threat to real-world face authentication systems on smartphones, tablets, and laptops. Our results show that the percentage of vulnerable users that are subject to spoofing attacks is high, which is about 64 percent for laptop users, and 93 percent smartphone/tablet users. We investigate liveness detection methods in the real-world face authentication systems against OSNFD threat. We discover that under protection of liveness detection, the percentage of vulnerable images is 18.8 percent, but the percentage of vulnerable users is as high as 73.3 percent. This evidence suggests that the current face authentication systems are not strong enough under OSNFD attacks. Finally, we develop a risk estimation tool based on logistic regression, and analyze the impacts of key attributes of facial images on the OSNFD risk. Our statistical analysis reveals that the most influential attributes of facial images are image resolution, facial makeup, occluded eyes, and illumination. This tool can be used to evaluate OSNFD risk for OSN images to increase users' awareness of OSNFD. © 2004-2012 IEEE.

AB Face recognition is a widely used biometric technology due to its convenience but it is vulnerable to spoofing attacks made by nonreal faces such as photographs or videos of valid users. The antispoof problem must be well resolved before widely applying face recognition in our daily life. Face liveness detection is a core technology to make sure that the input face is a live person. However, this is still very challenging using conventional liveness detection approaches of texture analysis and motion detection. The aim of this paper is to propose a feature descriptor and an efficient framework that can be used to effectively deal with the face liveness detection problem. In this framework, new feature descriptors are defined using a multiscale directional transform (shearlet transform). Then, stacked autoencoders and a softmax classifier are concatenated to detect face liveness. We evaluated this approach using the CASIA Face antispoofing database and replay-attack database. The experimental results show that our approach performs better than the state-of-the-art techniques following the provided protocols of these databases, and it is possible to significantly enhance the security of the face recognition biometric system. In addition, the experimental results also demonstrate that this framework can be easily extended to classify different spoofing attacks. © 2016 SPIE and IS and T.

AB Cataplexy, the hallmark of narcolepsy, has been well characterized in adults but not in children. This study systematically used structured clinical assessments and video-recordings (49 episodes in eight cases) to evaluate cataplexy in 23 patients diagnosed before the age of 18 years. Forty-three percent of patients had falls as part of their attacks. During cataplexy knees, head, and jaw were the most frequently compromised body segments; eyelids, arms, and trunk being less commonly involved. More rarely, blurred vision, slurred speech, irregular breathing, or a sudden loss of smiling mimics were reported. One-third of the sample presented with a previously unrecognized description of cataplexy that we coined "cataplectic facies," consisting of a state of semipermanent eyelid and jaw weakness, on which partial or complete cataplectic attacks were superimposed. The usual triggering emotions, such as laughter, joking, or anger, were not always present, especially when close to an abrupt onset, hampering diagnosis. Video-recordings of cataplectic attacks may be useful to document the attack, allowing a comparison with archived presentations. © 2008 Movement Disorder Society.

AB Cognitive radio technique has been recognized as an effective solution to the dilemma introduced by the rapid growth of wireless communications and the scarcity of spectrum resources. One example of the cognitive radio systems is the wireless regional area network operating in television white space (TVWS) spectrum, which has been specified by IEEE 802.22 standard. The wireless regional area networks in TVWS face not only the traditional security threats but also cognitive security challenges. Especially, the authentication between the base station and the customer premises equipment is vital for secure communication. We discovered that the authentication protocol specified in IEEE 802.22 is vulnerable to the interleaving attacks and cannot achieve mutual key confirmation. In this paper, an Enhanced Certificate-based Authentication scheme (ECA) has been proposed to overcome the vulnerability of the authentication scheme in IEEE 802.22 standard with much less requirements on the computation and communication resources. The drawbacks of the authentication protocol in IEEE 802.22 standard has been explored followed by the presentation of the proposed enhanced authentication protocol, ECA. The ECA protocol has been evaluated in terms of security functionality and the performance. The correctness of the Enhanced Certificate-based Authentication scheme is analyzed by the Burrows, Abadi, and Needham logic. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Background: Non-hereditary angioedema (non-HAE) is characterized by local swelling due to self-limiting, subcutaneous or submucosal extravasation of fluid, and can be divided into three subtypes. These subtypes are believed to have different pathophysiological backgrounds and are referred to in recent guidelines as bradykinin-mediated (e.g. caused by angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors), mast cell-mediated (e.g. angioedema with wheals) or idiopathic (cause unknown). Bradykinin-mediated subtypes are more closely related to hereditary angioedema than the other forms. Because clinical features of these non-HAE subtypes have not been studied in detail, we have looked at the clinical characteristics of symptoms and potential differences in clinical presentation of bradykinin-mediated and mast cellmediated angioedema (AE) subtypes. Methods: A questionnaire was sent to patients presenting with AE at our tertiary outpatient clinic to document clinical characteristics, potential triggers and location of AE. The severity of AE attacks was analysed using visual analogue scales (VAS). Results: The questionnaire was returned by 106 patients, of which 104 were included in the analysis. AE with wheals, idiopathic AE, and drug-associated AE occurred in 64 (62%), 25 (24%) and 15 patients (14%) respectively. Most patients (62%) reported prodromal symptoms while 63% reported multiple locations for an attack. Face and oropharynx were the main locations of AE attacks of any subtype while swelling was the symptom most frequently reported as severe. Overall severity of the last attack was indicated as severe by 68% of the patients. There were no differences between the subgroups. Conclusion: This similarity in clinical presentation raises the possibility that ACEi-induced, mast cell-mediated and idiopathic AE share common pathways. © 2015 Schulkes et al.

AB Although multi-modal (e.g. voice and face) biometric verification systems were in active development and showed impressive performance they need to be protected from spoofing attacks. In this paper we present methods for verifying face liveness based on estimation of synchrony between audio stream and lips movements track during the pronunciation of passphrase. The passphrase consists of a random set of the predetermined English words that are generated dynamically for each verification attempt. Lip movements extraction is performed by using of so-called Constrained Local Model of face shape. Audio stream is used to determine time intervals of pronounced words by means of automatic segmentation. Estimation of synchrony is done by analysis of lip movements for each word by employing a feedforward neural network and a Gaussian naive Bayes classifier. Finally, liveness score assessment is performed by averaging of individual word predictions during verification phrase utterance. For GRID corpus dataset average EER of 4.38% was achieved. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB The spoofing attack, in which the attacker disguises himself or herself as an authenticated user by showing the user's photographs or video clips before the camera, is a common adversarial attack in face recognition. To ensure the security of the system, face liveness detection is carried out to distinguish the images captured from a live face from those from a forged face. In this paper, we propose a face liveness detection method based on the High Frequency Descriptor to combat the spoofing attack. The additional illumination is added, which can raise the energy of high frequency components of a real face by exposing more details of the hair and skin, and lower it by causing a glisten on the planar surface. The difference of the energy of high frequency components between images with and without the illumination is calculated. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the original method and has robustness when the resolution of the attack media is high. © 2014 IEEE.

AB The growing sophistication and diversity of malicious activity in the Internet presents a serious challenge for network security analysts. In this paper, we describe our efforts to develop a database and query language for network attack data from firewalls, intrusion detection systems and honeynets. Our first step toward this objective is to develop a prototype database and query interface to identify coordinated scanning activity in network attack data. We have created a set of aggregate views and templatized SQL queries that consider timing, persistence, targeted services, spatial dispersion and temporal dispersion, thereby enabling us to evaluate coordinated scanning along these dimensions. We demonstrate the utility of the interface by conducting a case study on a set of firewall and intrusion detection system logs from Dshield.org. We show that the interface is able to identify general characteristics of coordinated activity as well as instances of unusual activity that would otherwise be difficult to mine from the data. These results highlight the potential for developing a more generalized query language for a broad class of network intrusion data. The case study also exposes some of the challenges we face in extending our system to more generalized queries over potentially vast quantities of data. © 2006 IEEE.

AB As a contribution to establishing the antecedents of nurse-midwifery, this article focuses on the career of Louyse Bourgeois (1563-1636), a major figure in the history of modern midwifery. She was the first midwife to publish a book on obstetrics and the first to publish on midwifery. Within her writings she outlined clear guidelines for sound clinical practice and articulated an ethical code to govern the practice of midwives. For example, Bourgeois recommended induced labor in cases of contracted pelvis; she was the first to discuss the management of umbilical prolapse; she offered a detailed description of face presentation and its management; and she was the first to cut the cord between two ligatures, when it was wrapped about the neck. She was an ambitious woman, not only for her personal advancement but for the advancement of female midwives as a group. More than 350 years ago she called for improvements in the training of midwives and saw the value of providing midwives with theoretical framework in support of clinical practice. As midwife to the Queen of France and to other influential families, Bourgeois took advantage of every opportunity to improve her own position and that of her calling. Her eventual fall from prominence, due to attacks by physicians and surgeons, is remarkably similar to the emotional conflict that surrounds present day nurse-midwife and medical profession confrontations over practice issues. © 1981.

AB Face presentation attacks are the main threats to face recognition systems, and many presentation attack detection (PAD) methods have been proposed in recent years. Although these methods have achieved significant performance in some specific intrusion modes, difficulties still exist in addressing replayed video attacks. That is because the replayed fake faces contain a variety of aliveness signals, such as eye blinking and facial expression changes. Replayed video attacks occur when attackers try to invade biometric systems by presenting face videos in front of the cameras, and these videos are often launched by a liquid-crystal display (LCD) screen. Due to the smearing effects and movements of LCD, videos captured from the real and replayed fake faces present different motion blurs, which are reflected mainly in blur intensity variation and blur width. Based on these descriptions, a motion blur analysis-based method is proposed to deal with the replayed video attack problem. We first present a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) for motion blur intensity variation description in the time domain, which consists of a serial of 1D convolutional and pooling filters. Then, a local similar pattern (LSP) feature is introduced to extract blur width. Finally, features extracted from 1D CNN and LSP are fused to detect the replayed video attacks. Extensive experiments on two standard face PAD databases, i.e., relay-attack and OULU-NPU, indicate that our proposed method based on the motion blur analysis significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and shows excellent generalization capability. © 2019 IEEE.

AB To enhance the security level of digital information, the biometric authentication method based on Electrocardiographic (ECG) is gaining increasing attention in a wide range of applications. Compared with other biometric features, e.g., fingerprint and face, the ECG signals have several advantages, such as higher security, simpler acquisition, liveness detection, and health information. Therefore, various methods for ECG-based authentication have been proposed. However, the generalization ability of these methods is limited because the feature extraction for the ECG signals in conventional methods is data dependent. To improve the generalization ability and achieve more stable results on different datasets, a parallel multi-scale one-dimensional residual network is proposed in this paper. This network utilizes three convolutional kernels with different kernel sizes, achieving better classification accuracy than the conventional schemes. Moreover, two loss functions named center loss and margin loss are used during the training of the network. Compared with the conventional softmax loss, these two loss functions can further improve the generalization ability of the extracted embedding features. Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method thoroughly on the ECG-ID database, the PTB Diagnostic ECG database, and the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database, achieving 2.00%, 0.59%, and 4.74% of equal error rate (EER), respectively. Compared with other works, our proposed method improves 1.61% and 4.89% classification accuracy on the ECG-ID database and the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database, respectively. © 2019 IEEE.

AB The face morphing attack enables the illegitimate sharing of photo-ID documents intended for identity verification. Multiple users may use the same passport, driver license or health insurance card without being condemned. This paper summarizes recent advances in protecting the photo-ID-based verification from the morphing attack. We explain the attack along with the standard approach of creating morphed face images. We identify research gaps and open challenges by summarizing studies assessing the potential of the morphing attack as well as studies concerned with generating databases of morphed face images and examining the performance of morphing detectors. We discuss new performance metrics looking for conformity with the standard on presentation attack detection. Based on the current advances, we recommend technical and organizational security mechanisms to mitigate or even prevent the morphing attack. © EURASIP 2018.

AB High-quality custom-made 3D masks are increasing becoming a serious threat to face-recognition systems. This threat is driven, in part, by the falling cost of manufacturing such masks. Research in face presentation-attack detection (PAD) in general, and also specifically for 3D-mask based attacks, has mostly concentrated on imagery in the visible-light range of wavelengths (RGB). We look beyond imagery in the visible-light spectrum to find potentially easier solutions for the challenge of face presentation-attack detection (PAD). In particular, we explore the use of near-infrared (NIR) and thermal imagery to detect print-, replay-, and 3D-mask-attacks. This preliminary study shows that both NIR and thermal imagery can potentially simplify the task of face-PAD. © 2017 Gesellschaft fuer Informatik.

AB Spoofing identities using photographs is one of the most common techniques to attack 2-D face recognition systems. There seems to exist no comparative studies of different techniques using the same protocols and data. The motivation behind this competition is to compare the performance of different state-of-the-art algorithms on the same database using a unique evaluation method. Six different teams from universities around the world have participated in the contest. Use of one or multiple techniques from motion, texture analysis and liveness detection appears to be the common trend in this competition. Most of the algorithms are able to clearly separate spoof attempts from real accesses. The results suggest the investigation of more complex attacks. © 2011 IEEE.

AB Due to advances in technology, today's biometric systems become vulnerable to spoof attacks made by fake faces. These attacks occur when an intruder attempts to fool an established face-based recognition system by presenting a fake face (e.g., print photo or replay attacks) in front of the camera instead of the intruder's genuine face. For this purpose, face antispoofing has become a hot topic in face analysis literature, where several applications with antispoofing task have emerged recently. We propose a solution for distinguishing between real faces and fake ones. Our approach is based on extracting features from the difference between successive frames instead of individual frames. We also used a multilevel representation that divides the frame difference into multiple multiblocks. Different texture descriptors (local binary patterns, local phase quantization, and binarized statistical image features) have then been applied to each block. After the feature extraction step, a Fisher score is applied to sort the features in ascending order according to the associated weights. Finally, a support vector machine is used to differentiate between real and fake faces. We tested our approach on three publicly available databases: CASIA Face Antispoofing database, Replay-Attack database, and MSU Mobile Face Spoofing database. The proposed approach outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods in different media and quality metrics. © 2017 SPIE and IS&T.

AB Face liveness detection is an advanced research topic nowadays due to its significant security applications in various fields and is of utmost paramountcy to ascertain the physical presence of person. The spoofing problem is a ferocious threat to security of the face recognition systems and it can be minimized by detecting the face liveness. In this paper, a robust anti-spoofing technique for face liveness detection with morphological operations has been proposed by considering eyeblink and mouth movements for procuring maximum reliability during face liveness detection. ZJU Eyeblink dataset, Print-Attack Replay dataset and in-house dataset created in our university have been used for experimental purpose. ZJU Eyeblink dataset has been used to capture eyeblink, Print – Attack Replay dataset has been used to detect photo and video attack based on eyeblink while both eyeblink and mouth movements have been detected simultaneously using in-house dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed anti-spoofing technique significantly improves the security of a face recognition system by detecting face liveness. The efficiency of the proposed technique has been prosperously evaluated by detecting photo and video spoofing attacks. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH

AB Biometric authentication systems are pervasive in modern society, but they are quite vulnerable to spoofing attacks. Research on spoofing (or liveness) detection is therefore very active. A number of methods have been proposed in the literature, sometimes with very promising results, but limited robustness with respect to the large variety of biometric traits, sensors, and attacks encountered in real-life. Recently, methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are drawing great attention, given their success in many other image processing tasks. However, despite some promising results, they seem to suffer the same robustness problem, requiring heavy training to work properly. Here, we propose a new CNN architecture for biometric spoofing detection. Thanks to domain-specific knowledge, accounted for through a suitable loss function, a compact architecture is obtained, allowing reliable training also in the presence of small-size datasets. Experiments prove the proposal to provide state-of-art performance on several widespread datasets for face and iris liveness detection. © 2016 IEEE.

AB Multi-spectral face recognition has been an active area of research over the past few decades. However, the vulnerability of multi-spectral face recognition systems is a growing concern that argues the need for Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) (or countermeasure or anti-spoofing) schemes to successfully detect targeted attacks. In this work, we present a novel feature descriptor LαMTiF that can effectively capture time-frequency features from the maximum response obtained on the high pass band image, which is obtained from the scale-space decomposition of the presented image. The proposed feature descriptor can effectively capture the micro-texture patterns that can be effectively used describe the variation from the presented image. We then propose a new framework using the proposed LαMTiF features that process the input multi-spectral face image independently. These extracted features are then classified using a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) to obtain the binary decision. Finally, we carry out a decision fusion using the And rule to obtain the final decision. Extensive experiments are carried out on publicly available multi-spectral face datasets that have indicated the efficacy of the proposed scheme. © 2016 IEEE.

AB Person identification is an essential task in defense and forensic applications such as surveillance and criminal investigation activities. Studies conducted in the past included different types of regular biometric traits, namely fingerprint, face, iris, and voice have a limitation of falsification, and they do not fit guarantee of liveness of the subject. In this context, Electrocardiogram based Biometric recognition is an alternative solution, where the security of the information is very high level. This research aims to provide with a complete systematic approach to ECG based Biometric recognition, which contains primarily the processing of raw signal through noise elimination filters and a time domain analysis is carried for all ECG characteristic waves detection. Subsequently, an effective feature extraction method for ECG is developed, which extracts six best P-QRS-T fragments based on priority and their positions are normalized. Also, 72-time domain features are calculated. These features are formed into feature vector corresponding to each signal separately for both train and test data sets. To analyze the performance of the system, the feature vectors are trained with various Machine learning classification algorithms like Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). Finally, the proposed system is tested with a challenging, public available MIT-BIH ECG-ID Database. A comparative analysis using performance parameters is made with different classifiers, and the obtained results show that SVM classifier provides 93.709% overall classification accuracy when compared to previous literature. © 2017 Eastern Macedonia and Thrace Institute of Technology.

AB Background and objectives: Pemphigoid gestationis (PG) is a rare autoimmune-mediated blistering disease that mainly affects pregnant women in their 2nd or 3rd trimester and immediate postpartum period. In addition to the clinical assessment, the diagnosis of PG is usually confirmed by histological and immunological studies. PG usually flares up at the time of delivery and spontaneously improves postpartum. Prompt recognition and appropriate management may reduce morbidity associated with this disorder. This study aimed to determine the clinical, histopathological features and treatment of PG of Saudi patients. Materials and methods: A retrospective study of 32 patients with pemphigoid gestationis (PG) was conducted from 1990 to 2014 at King Khalid University Hospital and Derma Medical Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Data regarding epidemiology, medical histories, clinical course, diagnostic test results and management were collected and analyzed. Results: A total of 32 patients with PG were analyzed. The mean age was 31.9 years. Seventy-four percent of the patients were multigravidas, and 2 patients were primigravidas. One hundred percent of the cases were singleton pregnancies. Eighty-four percent of the cases had the onset of PG during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. One hundred percent of patients complained of pruritus, and 94% reported this as the first symptom. Erythematous plaques and vesiculobullous eruption were the most common skin presentation. The primary sites of involvement were the abdomen, trunk, lower (mainly thighs) and upper limbs. The face and mucus membranes were rarely involved. Fifty percent of patients had recurrent symptoms with their next pregnancy. Direct immunofluorescence revealed a linear deposition of the third component of the complement along the basement membrane zone in all cases (C3),while most of the cases showed positive linear deposition of IgG. Seventy five percent of our patients had a good response to oral corticosteroids, and only one patient needed IVIG. The vast majority of the patients (61%) became free of symptoms within 1-2 months of treatment. In 53% of the patients, maternal and fetal outcomes were good with no complications. Six pregnancies were complicated by preterm labor, 2 experienced IUGR (intrauterine growth restriction), and 2 had an abortion or stillbirth. Conclusion: Our study does not differ dramatically when comparing the onset of PG, the high frequency of multigravida women, the clinical course and good patient outcomes but we observed that the first attack extended from primigravida to 11th pregnancy and slight increase in recurrence rate. Finally the timely diagnosis and appropriate management of PG ma

AB Current biometric modalities include fingerprint, palm, voice, face, gate, iris and even DNA recognition. Another known biometric technique involves subject identification using retinal Mood vasculature pattern matching. Regardless of the modality, however, there is an inherent requirement for liveness detection so as to make the acquisition system less susceptible to deception. One possible solution for retina scanning systems is verification of blood llow in the retinal vessels - the definite feature of live tissue. Laser speckle contrast imaging is a common method of blood flow detection and could be used to explicitly confirm liveness. The dynamics of the speckle pattern can be statistically quantified and interpreted as the regions with and without flow. Using a model of the retinal vasculature, this paper reviews speckle contrast imaging as it applies to liveness verification by means of blood flow detection in retina-based biometric systems. © 2016 IEEE.

AB Todays biometric systems are vulnerable to spoof attacks made by non-real faces. The problem is when a person shows in front of camera a print photo or a picture from cell phone. We study in this paper an anti-spoofing solution for distinguishing between 'live' and 'fake' faces. In our approach we used overlapping block LBP operator to extract features in each region of the image. To reduce the features we used Fisher-Score. Finally, we used a nonlinear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with kernel function for determining whether the input image corresponds to a live face or not. Our experimental analysis on a publicly available NUAA and CASIA face anti-spoofing databases following the standard protocols showed good results. © 2015 IEEE.

AB Forged biometric systems are a crucial obstacle in the field of biometrics. Fake biometric identifiers can be of the form where one person imitates as another by falsifying data and thereby gaining an illegitimate advantage. This can be achieved either by using fake self manufactured synthetic or reconstructed samples. Gender classification has become an essential part in most human computer interactions especially in high security areas where gender restrictions are provided. In this paper, software based multi-biometric system that is used to classify real and fake face samples and a gender classification are presented. The main objective of the paper is to improve biometric detection in a fast, non intrusive way which maintains the generality that is lacking in other anti-spoofing methods. The proposed method incorporates liveness detection, extracts 30 general image quality measures from the input image and then classifies the input into real or fake sample. Algorithm for Gender classification is developed in accordance with the facial features. There features are classified into two i) appearance based ii) Geometric based. The image quality assessment algorithm is developed and tested with ATVS database. The gender classification with image quality assessment is developed and tested with medical students database. © 2015 IEEE.

AB The vulnerability of biometric authentication systems to spoofing attacks is now a widely accepted fact. A spoofing attack occurs when an impostor attempts to masquerade as genuine user by falsifying biometric data and thereby gaining illegitimate access. Several liveness detection methods have been proposed, which consist in determining whether there is a live person in front of the biometric sensor or an artificial replica. But, the problem is still unresolved owing to high level difficulty in determining efficient features with low computational cost to detect the spoofing attacks. In addition, existing methods are not particularly targeted for liveness detection in mobile biometric applications, thus mainly inapplicable for portable devices. Hence, we present a multi-biometric approach, that can detect face, iris and fingerprint spoofing attacks in mobile applications, by employing a novel real-time feature description based on order permutations, named Locally Uniform Comparison Image Descriptor (LUCID). LUCID is computable in linear time with respect to number of pixels and does not require floating point computation, beside the fact that typical mobile devices perform poorly for floating point applications. Our approach is therefore exclusively simple, fast and efficient, making it thus highly suitable for mobile devices. Moreover, contrary to existing schemes, our method utilize the same lone image descriptor technique effectively for three biometric traits, i.e. face, iris and fingerprint, liveness detection. Additionally, our method uses only one image for liveness detection, which can also be used for recognition. Experiments on publicly available face, iris and fingerprint data sets with real spoofing attacks show promising results. © 2014 IEEE.

AB A technique evaluating liveness in short face image sequences is presented. The intended purpose of the proposed system is to assist in a biometric authentication framework, by adding liveness awareness in a non-intrusive manner. Analysing the trajectories of single parts of a live face reveal valuable information to discriminate it against a spoofed one. The proposed system uses a lightweight novel optical flow, which is especially applicable in face motion estimation based on the structure tensor and a few frames. It uses a model-based local Gabor decomposition and SVM experts for face part detection. An alternative approach for face part detection using optical flow pattern matching is introduced as well. Experimental results on the proposed system are presented.

AB The face mask presentation attack introduces a greater threat to the face recognition system. With the evolving technology in generating both 2D and 3D masks in a more sophisticated, realistic and cost effective manner encloses the face recognition system to more challenging vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present a novel Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) scheme that explores both global (i.e. face) and local (i.e. periocular or eye) region to accurately identify the presence of both 2D and 3D face masks. The proposed PAD algorithm is based on both Binarized Statistical Image Features (BSIF) and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) that can capture a prominent micro-texture features. The linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) is then trained independently on these two features that are applied on both local and global region to obtain the comparison scores. We then combine these scores using the weighted sum rule before making the decision about a normal (or real or live) or an artefact (or spoof) face. Extensive experiments are carried out on two publicly available databases for 2D and 3D face masks namely: CASIA face spoof database and 3DMAD shows the efficacy of the proposed scheme when compared with well-established state-of-the-art techniques. © 2014 International Society of Information Fusion.

AB Scripting has become an integral part of design work in Computer-Aided Design (CAD), especially with parametric systems. Designers who script face a very steep learning and use curve due to the new (to them) script notation and the loss of direct manipulation of the model. Programming In the Model (PIM) is a prototype parametric CAD system with a live interface with side-by-side model and script windows,real-time updating of the script and the model,ondemand dependency, object and script representations in the model,and operation preview (lookahead). These features aim to break the steep learning and use curve of scripting into small steps and to bring programming and modeling tasks 'closer together.' A qualitative user study with domain experts shows the importance of multi-directional live scripting and script localization within the model. Other PIM features show promise but require additional design work to create a better user experience. Copyright © 2014 ACM.

AB Next generation SOA systems promise to enable an "Internet of Services" - an open environment, in which every participant is not only free to offer and consume services, but also to provide central components of the ecosystem, such as marketplaces and community portals. In such an environment with no or only very little central control, malicious users may try to gain profits by providing low quality services. An approach to solve this issue is to introduce a trust or reputation system, enabling market participants to identify trustworthy parties. An open market does not have access restrictions to the market, hence such systems are likely to be exposed to Sybil attacks. In this paper, we provide a novel approach for aggregating recommendations in the face of Sybil attacks, which allow a single party to try to multiply the influence of its recommendation(s) by creating a high number of seemingly independent entities. © 2009 IEEE.

AB The XI Congress of the International Headache Society (IHC) provided useful feedback for a wide range of disciplines for all scientists involved in basic and applied research concerning headaches. The major topics of the Congress included comorbidity, paediatric headache, phenotypic markers, genetics, migraine therapy, trigeminal neuralgia and paroxysmal facial pain with autonomic signs. The most recent advances were presented and discussed and all efforts were made to transfer these new understandings of pathogenesis, clinical features and treatments, to clinical practice, in an attempt to gain a better understanding of patient problems and requests. The Presidential Symposium, which anticipated the scientific sessions, provided the most updated knowledge regarding neuroimaging, neurophysiological and potential clinical implications of the activation of brainstem structures as well as the dependency of cortical events on this activation during migraine attacks. The results of the strenuous work carried out from autumn 1999 to 2003 of an International Committee of headache experts, presided by J. Olesen, reached its peak with the presentation of the new international Headache Classification ICHD-II. There are many relevant changes in the new classification, even though the basic structure and the most important criteria, such as those for migraine without aura and tension-type headache, have been maintained. Several new entities have been added including chronic migraine for patients having migraine ≥ 15 days/month. New rules separate primary and secondary headaches and a new chapter now presents headaches attributed to psychiatric disorders. Headaches due to disturbance of homeostasis has been brought together in a new chapter and the diagnostic criteria for secondary headaches are now more systematically constructed. All these changes will hopefully promote research, especially for the novel entities reported in the appendix, which have not been sufficiently validated or for which sufficient evidence still has not been published. 2004 © Ashley Publications Ltd.

AB In some people an attack of migraine may be provoked by heading a football or a blow on the face in a rugby tackle. The attack is sometimes alarming and clearly cannot be explained on a basis of trauma alone. Some people only have attacks in this particular circumstance but the majority have spontaneous episodes at other times. The presentation is usually in childhood or early adult life. The syndrome is discussed in relation to reports of seven patients to illustrate the variations which include migraine without headache and persistent features after the attack. The condition is benign but may cause the patient to give up playing football.

AB Face anti-spoofing is designed to keep face recognition systems from recognizing fake faces as the genuine users. While advanced face anti-spoofing methods are developed, new types of spoof attacks are also being created and becoming a threat to all existing systems. We define the detection of unknown spoof attacks as Zero-Shot Face Anti-spoofing (ZSFA). Previous works of ZSFA only study 1-2 types of spoof attacks, such as print/replay attacks, which limits the insight of this problem. In this work, we expand the ZSFA problem to a wide range of 13 types of spoof attacks, including print attack, replay attack, 3D mask attacks, and so on. A novel Deep Tree Network (DTN) is proposed to tackle the ZSFA. The tree is learned to partition the spoof samples into semantic sub-groups in an unsupervised fashion. When a data sample arrives, being know or unknown attacks, DTN routes it to the most similar spoof cluster, and make the binary decision. In addition, to enable the study of ZSFA, we introduce the first face anti-spoofing database that contains diverse types of spoof attacks. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves the state of the art on multiple testing protocols of ZSFA. © 2019 IEEE.

DE And Body Pose; Biometrics; Face; Gesture;
AB Face anti-spoofing is an important task in full-stack face applications including face detection, verification, and recognition. Previous approaches build models on datasets which do not simulate the real-world data well (e.g., small scale, insignificant variance, etc.). Existing models may rely on auxiliary information, which prevents these anti-spoofing solutions from generalizing well in practice. In this paper, we present a data collection solution along with a data synthesis technique to simulate digital medium-based face spoofing attacks, which can easily help us obtain a large amount of training data well reflecting the real-world scenarios. Through exploiting a novel Spatio-Temporal Anti-Spoof Network (STASN), we are able to push the performance on public face anti-spoofing datasets over state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Since the proposed model can automatically attend to discriminative regions, it makes analyzing the behaviors of the network possible.We conduct extensive experiments and show that the proposed model can distinguish spoof faces by extracting features from a variety of regions to seek out subtle evidences such as borders, moire patterns, reflection artifacts, etc. © 2019 IEEE.

AB We present a novel scheme for continuous face authentication using mobile device cameras that addresses the issue of spoof attacks and attack windows in state-of-the-art approaches. Our scheme authenticates a user based on extracted facial features. However, unlike other schemes that periodically re-authenticate a user, our scheme tracks the authenticated face and only attempts re-authentication when the authenticated face is lost. This allows our scheme to eliminate attack windows that exist in schemes authenticating periodically and immediately recognise impostor usage. We also introduce a robust liveness detection component to our scheme that can detect printed faces and face videos. We describe how the addition of liveness detection enhances the robustness of our scheme against spoof attacks, improving on state-of-the-art approaches that lack this capability. Furthermore, we create the first dataset of facial videos collected from mobile devices during different real-world activities (walking, sitting and standing) such that our results reflect realistic scenarios. Our dataset therefore allows us to give new insight into the impact of user activity on facial recognition. Our dataset also includes spoofed facial videos for liveness testing. We use our dataset alongside two benchmark datasets for our experiments. We show and discuss how our scheme improves on existing continuous face authentication approaches and efficiently enhances device security. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Non-reference image quality measures (IQM) as well as their associated natural scene statistics (NSS) are used to distinguish real biometric data from fake data as used in presentation/sensor spoofing attacks. An experimental study shows that a support vector machine directly trained on NSS as used in blind/referenceless image spatial quality evaluator provides highly accurate classification of real versus fake iris, fingerprint, face, and fingervein data in generic manner. This contrasts to using the IQM directly, the accuracy of which turns out to be rather data set and parameter choice-dependent. While providing very low average classification error rate values for complete training data, generalisation to unseen attack types is difficult in open-set scenarios and obtained accuracy varies in almost unpredictable manner. This implies that for each given sensor/attack set-up, the ability of the introduced methods to detect unseen attacks needs to be assessed separately. © 2018 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

AB Among biometric recognition systems such as fingerprint, finger-vein, or face, the iris recognition system has proven to be effective for achieving a high recognition accuracy and security level. However, several recent studies have indicated that an iris recognition system can be fooled by using presentation attack images that are recaptured using high-quality printed images or by contact lenses with printed iris patterns. As a result, this potential threat can reduce the security level of an iris recognition system. In this study, we propose a new presentation attack detection (PAD) method for an iris recognition system (iPAD) using a near infrared light (NIR) camera image. To detect presentation attack images, we first localized the iris region of the input iris image using circular edge detection (CED). Based on the result of iris localization, we extracted the image features using deep learning-based and handcrafted-based methods. The input iris images were then classified into real and presentation attack categories using support vector machines (SVM). Through extensive experiments with two public datasets, we show that our proposed method effectively solves the iris recognition presentation attack detection problem and produces detection accuracy superior to previous studies. © 2018 by the authors.

AB User authentication is an important step to protect information, and in this context, face biometrics is potentially advantageous. Face biometrics is natural, intuitive, easy to use, and less human-invasive. Unfortunately, recent work has revealed that face biometrics is vulnerable to spoofing attacks using cheap low-tech equipment. This paper introduces a novel and appealing approach to detect face spoofing using the spatiotemporal (dynamic texture) extensions of the highly popular local binary pattern operator. The key idea of the approach is to learn and detect the structure and the dynamics of the facial micro-textures that characterise real faces but not fake ones. We evaluated the approach with two publicly available databases (Replay-Attack Database and CASIA Face Anti-Spoofing Database). The results show that our approach performs better than state-of-the-art techniques following the provided evaluation protocols of each database. © 2014 Pereira et al.; licensee Springer.

AB Currently the demand for the development of more precise and reliable methods of person identification have received attention from the academic community and industry, with Biometrics being one of these new approaches. The term 'Biometrics' is used to refer to identification techniques based on physical or behavioural characteristics. As biometric recognition becomes increasingly popular, the fear of circumvention, obfuscation and replay attacks is a rising concern. Since the traditional biometric modalities (face, iris and fingerprint) are not able to supply the needs of every possible security requirement, numerous emerging biometric modalities are presented, trying to fill the gap. Biomedical signals, like electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG), have been proposed as emerging biometric modalities. The advantages of using the ECG for biometric recognition can be summarized as universality, permanence, uniqueness, robustness to attacks, liveness detection. According to the utilized features, the existing ECG based biometric systems can be classified to fiducial, non-fiducial and hybrids systems. This papers analyses the impact of some feature selection strategies like Genetic Algorithm, Memetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization on the performance of Biometric Systems based on ECG using K-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machines, Optimum Path Forest and a Euclidean Distance Classifier for classification task. The results show that there is a subset of features extracted from the ECG signal that provides high recognition rates. © 2017 IEEE.

AB Face recognition is a widely used biometric technology due to its convenience but it is vulnerable to spoofing attacks made by non-real faces such as a photograph or video of valid user. Face liveness detection is a core technology to make sure that the input face is a live person. However, this is still very challenging using conventional liveness detection approaches of texture analysis and motion detection. The aim of this paper is to develop a multifunctional feature descriptor and an efficient framework which can be used to deal with both face liveness detection and recognition. In this framework, new feature descriptors are defined using a multiscale directional transform (shearlet transform). Then, stacked autoencoders and softmax classifier are concatenated to detect face liveness and identify person. We evaluated this approach using CASIA Face Anti-Spoofing Database and the results show that our approach performs better than state-of-the-art techniques following the provided evaluation protocols of this database, and is possible to significantly enhance the security of face recognition biometric system. © 2016 IEEE.

AB Audiovisual speech synchrony detection is an important liveness check for talking face verification systems in order to make sure that the input biometric samples are actually acquired from the same source. In prior work, the used visual speech features have been mainly describing facial appearance or mouth shape in frame-wise manner, thus ignoring the lip motion between consecutive frames. Since also the visual speech dynamics are important, we take the spatiotemporal information into account and propose the use of space-time auto-correlation of gradients (STACOG) for measuring the audiovisual synchrony. For evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a set of challenging and realistic attack scenarios are designed by augmenting publicly available BANCA and XM2VTS datasets with synthetic replay attacks. Our experimental analysis shows that the STACOG features outperform the state of the art, e.g. discrete cosine transform based features, in measuring the audiovisual synchrony. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB Face liveness detection is an interesting research topic in face-based online authentication. The current face liveness detection algorithms utilize either static or dynamic features, but not both. In fact, the dynamic and static features have different advantages in face liveness detection. In this paper, we discuss a scheme to combine dynamic and static features that combines the strength of each. First, the dynamic maps are obtained from the inter frame motion in the video. Then, using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the dynamic and static features are extracted from the dynamic maps and the images, respectively. Next, the fully connected layers from the CNN that include the dynamic and static features are connected to form the fused features. Finally, the fused features are used to train a two-value Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, which classify the images into two groups, images with real faces and images with fake faces. We conduct experiments to assess our algorithm that includes classifying images from two public databases. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms current state-of-the-art face liveness detection algorithms. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.

AB Introduction: Idiopathic systemic capillary leak syndrome is a rare and fatal disease due to the unexplained episodic attacks of capillary leakage of plasma from the intravascular into the interstitial space. The attack consists of three phases, a prodromal phase, peripheral leak phase and recruitment phase. During the peripheral leak phase, generalized edema, mainly in the trunk and extremities, with hemoconcentration and hypoalbuminemia occurs, while usually the visceral organs like lungs, brain, heart and kidneys seem not to be involved. Treatment of the acute phase is supportive, focusing on adequate but not overzealous fluid resuscitation, because pulmonary edema usually occurs in the recruitment phase. Case presentation: A 65-year-old Japanese woman was admitted to our hospital because of severe hypovolemic shock with metabolic acidosis and hemoconcentration and hypoalbuminemia. Although she was considered to be in the peripheral leak phase of idiopathic systemic capillary leak syndrome, which could not be diagnosed during the treatment, the generalized edema worsened further, severe flash pulmonary edema progressed rapidly after fluid resuscitation and she died. The autopsy showed generalized edema, especially alveolar pulmonary edema without endothelial apoptosis. Conclusions: Because hypovolemic shock and fatal pulmonary edema may progress rapidly together even in the peripheral leak phase of idiopathic systemic capillary leak syndrome, we should keep in mind this rare and fatal disease and recognize the pathophysiology to treat it effectively when the patient has hypovolemia with metabolic acidosis. © 2015 Hirosaki et al.; licensee BioMed Central.

AB The existing face liveness detection algorithms have satisfying performance on spoofing photos by detecting the biological motion, including eye blinking, head rotation and mouth movement. However, the biological motions can be simulated by using video, which is called a video playback attack. This paper proposes a countermeasure to a video playback attack by analyzing the detail of hair using the Fourier spectra. We apply a flashlight to enhance the difference between the real person and the video playback attack. Experimental results suggest that the proposed method has an encouraging performance on face liveness detection. © 2014 IEEE.

AB Facial biometric system is a widely used approach in security industry. But face recognition systems are vulnerable to spoofing attacks which can be done by falsifying data using non-real faces and thereby gaining illegal access. An easy way to spoof face recognition systems is to use portrait photographs instead of the real person. Thus, Liveness detection is needed to make a system secure against such spoofing attacks. Inspired from the fact that the images taken from 2-D photographs and live faces are bound to have differences in terms of shape and detailedness, we present an approach based on frequency analysis and texture analysis by using frequency descriptor and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) respectively. Experiments which were done on publicly available database showed excellent results and can efficiently classify live faces and 2-D photographs. © 2014 IEEE.

AB Spoofing attacks on biometric systems are one of the major impediments to their use for secure unattended applications.This paper presents a novel method for face liveness detection by tracking the gaze of the user with an ordinary webcam. In the proposed system, an object appears randomly on the display screen which the user is required to look at while their gaze is measured. The visual stimulus appears in such a way that it repeatedly directs the gaze of the user to specific points on the screen. Features extracted from images captured at these sets of colocated points are used to estimate the liveness of the user. A scenario is investigated where genuine users track the challenge with head/eye movements whereas the impostors hold a photograph of the target user and attempt to follow the stimulus during simulated spoofing attacks. The results from the experiments indicate the effectiveness of the gaze colocation feature in detecting spoofing attack.

AB In this paper we propose liveness verification for enhancing the robustness of audio-visual biometric person authentication systems. Liveness verification ensures that biometric cues are acquired from a live person who is actually present at the time of capture for authenticating the identity. The proposed liveness checking technique based on cross-modal association models involves hybrid fusion of acoustic and visual speech correlation features, which measure the degree of synchrony between the lips and the voice extracted from speaking face video sequences. Performance evaluation in terms of DET (Detector Error Tradeoff) curves and EERs (Equal Error Rates) on publicly available audiovisual speech databases show a significant improvement in robustness of system against different types of simulated replay attacks. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB To prevent users' privacy from leakage, more and more mobile devices employ biometric-based authentication approaches, such as fingerprint, face recognition, voiceprint authentications, and so on, to enhance the privacy protection. However, these approaches are vulnerable to replay attacks. Although the state-of-art solutions utilize liveness verification to combat the attacks, existing approaches are sensitive to ambient environments, such as ambient lights and surrounding audible noises. Toward this end, we explore liveness verification of user authentication leveraging users' mouth movements, which are robust to noisy environments. In this paper, we propose a lip reading-based user authentication system, LipPass, which extracts unique behavioral characteristics of users' speaking mouths through acoustic sensing on smartphones for user authentication. We first investigate Doppler profiles of acoustic signals caused by users' speaking mouths and find that there are unique mouth movement patterns for different individuals. To characterize the mouth movements, we propose a deep learning-based method to extract efficient features from Doppler profiles and employ softmax function, support vector machine, and support vector domain description to construct multi-class identifier, binary classifiers, and spoofer detectors for mouth state identification, user identification, and spoofer detection, respectively. Afterward, we develop a balanced binary tree-based authentication approach to accurately identify each individual leveraging these binary classifiers and spoofer detectors with respect to registered users. Through extensive experiments involving 48 volunteers in four real environments, LipPass can achieve 90.2% accuracy in user identification and 93.1% accuracy in spoofer detection. © 2018 IEEE.

AB With the wide deployment of the face recognition systems in applications from deduplication to mobile device unlocking, security against the face spoofing attacks requires increased attention; such attacks can be easily launched via printed photos, video replays, and 3D masks of a face. We address the problem of face spoof detection against the print (photo) and replay (photo or video) attacks based on the analysis of image distortion (e.g., surface reflection, moiré pattern, color distortion, and shape deformation) in spoof face images (or video frames). The application domain of interest is smartphone unlock, given that the growing number of smartphones have the face unlock and mobile payment capabilities. We build an unconstrained smartphone spoof attack database (MSU USSA) containing more than 1000 subjects. Both the print and replay attacks are captured using the front and rear cameras of a Nexus 5 smartphone. We analyze the image distortion of the print and replay attacks using different: 1) intensity channels (R, G, B, and grayscale); 2) image regions (entire image, detected face, and facial component between nose and chin); and 3) feature descriptors. We develop an efficient face spoof detection system on an Android smartphone. Experimental results on the public-domain Idiap Replay-Attack, CASIA FASD, and MSU-MFSD databases, and the MSU USSA database show that the proposed approach is effective in face spoof detection for both the cross-database and intra-database testing scenarios. User studies of our Android face spoof detection system involving 20 participants show that the proposed approach works very well in real application scenarios. © 2016 IEEE.

AB Face presentation attack detection has received increasing attention ever since the vulnerabilities to spoofing have been widely recognized. The state of the art in software-based face anti-spoofing has been assessed in three international competitions organized in conjunction with major biometrics conferences in 2011, 2013, and 2017, each introducing new challenges to the research community. In this chapter, we present the design and results of the three competitions. The particular focus is on the latest competition, where the aim was to evaluate the generalization abilities of the proposed algorithms under some real-world variations faced in mobile scenarios, including previously unseen acquisition conditions, presentation attack instruments, and sensors. We also discuss the lessons learnt from the competitions and future challenges in the field in general. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB Automated detection of sensor level spoof attacks using 3D face masks is critical to protect integrity of face recognition systems deployed for security and surveillance. This paper investigates a multispectral imaging approach to more accurately detect such presentation attacks. Real human faces and spoof face images from 3D face masks are simultaneously acquired under visible and near infrared (multispectral) illumination using two separate sensors. Ranges of convolutional neural network based configurations are investigated to improve the detection accuracy from such presentation attacks. Our experimental results indicate that near-infrared based imaging of 3D face masks offers superior performance as compared to those for the respective real/spoof face images acquired under visible illumination. Combination of simultaneously acquired presentation attack images under multispectral illumination can be used to further improve the accuracy of detecting attacks from more realistic 3D face masks. © 2018 IEEE.

AB Face recognition systems can be tricked by photos or videos with virtual faces. It is crucial for a safe face recognition system to distinguish genuine user's faces (i.e., the first captured images of real scene) and spoof faces (i.e., recaptured images of photographs or videos). Existing face liveness methods often use single image feature to address face spoofing problems, which are not reliable and robust. In this paper, we analyze the differences between genuine face images and spoof images, and propose to extract three types of features, i.e., specular reflection ratio, Hue channel distribution and blurriness, to determine whether a face image is captured from genuine face or not. Experimental results on NUAA photograph imposter database show the competitive performance of our method comparing with several state-of-the-art methods. © 2017 IEEE.

AB Face authentication emerges as a powerful method for preventing unauthorized access to mobile devices. It is, however, vulnerable to photo-based forgery attacks (PFA) and videobased forgery attacks (VFA), in which the adversary exploits a photo or video containing the user's frontal face. Effective defenses against PFA and VFA often rely on liveness detection, which seeks to find a live indicator that the submitted face photo or video of the legitimate user is indeed captured in real time. In this paper, we propose FaceHeart, a novel and practical face authentication system for mobile devices. FaceHeart simultaneously takes a face video with the front camera and a fingertip video with the rear camera on COTS mobile devices. It then achieves liveness detection by comparing the two photoplethysmograms independently extracted from the face and fingertip videos, which should be highly consistent if the two videos are for the same live person and taken at the same time. As photoplethysmograms are closely tied to human cardiac activity and almost impossible to forge or control, FaceHeart is strongly resilient to PFA and VFA. Extensive user experiments on Samsung Galaxy S5 have confirmed the high efficacy and efficiency of FaceHeart. © 2017 IEEE.

AB Multispectral face recognition systems are widely used in various access control applications. The vulnerability of multispectral face recognition sensors towards low-cost Presentation Attack Instrument (PAI) such as printed photos used in attacks has emerged as a serious security threat. In this paper, we present a novel framework to detect presentation attacks against an extended multispectral face sensor. The proposed framework stems from the idea of exploring the complementary information available from different bands of an extended multispectral face sensor. To this extent, two different frameworks are proposed where the first framework is based on image fusion and the second builds on the Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) score level fusion. Extensive experiments are carried out on the extended multispectral face sensor database comprising of 50 subjects with two different presentation attacks generated using the printed photo artefacts. The obtained results indicate the superior performance of the PAD score level fusion on detecting both known and unknown attacks. © 2017 International Society of Information Fusion (ISIF).

AB Research in the area of automatic speaker verification (ASV) has advanced enough for the industry to start using ASV systems in practical applications. However, as it was also shown for fingerprints, face, and other verification systems, ASV systems are highly vulnerable to spoofing or presentation attacks, limiting their wide practical deployment. Therefore, to protect against such attacks, effective anti-spoofing detection techniques, more formally known as presentation attack detection (PAD) systems, need to be developed. These techniques should be then seamlessly integrated into existing ASV systems for practical all-in-one solutions. In this paper, we focus on the integration of PAD and ASV systems. We consider the state of the art i-vector and ISV-based ASV systems and demonstrate the effect of score-based integration with a PAD system on the verification and attack detection accuracies. In our experiments, we rely on AVspoof database that contains realistic presentation attacks, which are considered by the industry to be the threat to practical ASV systems. Experimental results show a significantly increased resistance of the joint ASV-PAD system to the attacks at the expense of slightly degraded performance for scenarios without spoofing attacks. Also, an important contribution of the paper is an open source and an online-based implementations of the separate and joint ASV-PAD systems. © 2016 IEEE.

AB In this paper, a smart face liveness detector is proposed to prevent the biometric system from being “deceived” by the video or picture of a valid user that the counterfeiter took with a high definition handheld device (e.g., iPad with retina display). By analyzing the characteristics of the display platform and using an expert decision-making core, we can effectively detect whether a spoofing action comes from a fake face displayed in the high definition display by verifying the chromaticity regions in the captured face. That is, a live or spoof face can be distinguished precisely by the designed optical image sensor. To sum up, by the proposed method/system, a normal optical image sensor can be upgraded to a powerful version to detect the spoofing actions. The experimental results prove that the proposed detection system can achieve very high detection rate compared to the existing methods and thus be practical to implement directly in the authentication systems. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB Since gaze is a kind of behavioral biometrics which is difficult to be detected by the surveillance due to the ambiguity of visual attention process, it can be used as a clue for anti-spoofing. This work provides the first investigation in research literature on the use of gaze estimation for face spoofing detection. Firstly, a gaze estimation model mapping the gaze feature to gaze position is established for tracking user’s gaze trajectory. Secondly, gaze histogram is obtained by quantifying and encoding the gaze trajectory. Finally, information entropy on gaze histogram suggests the uncertainty level of user’s gaze movement and estimates the liveness of the user. Our basic assumption is that the gaze trajectory of genuine access has higher uncertainty level than that of attack. Therefore, the greater the entropy, the more probable the user is genuine. Experimental results show that the proposed method obtains competitive performance in distinguishing attacks from genuine access. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB In this paper I will present a technique to generate a digital signature for an image, which will uniquely identify it, using Radon transform. Even if Radon based approaches are broadly applicable to tomography (the construction of an image from the projection data related with cross-sectional scans of it), in this research work I will show how it can be successfully utilized to classify images and detect face spoof attacks. This increased popularity of face recognition system has raised disquiets about biometric attacks, where a photo of an authorized person's face could be used by unauthorized individuals to access diverse services. The presented results prove this method offers similar performances to the state of the art and they were obtained using MATLAB 2013 environment and NUAA Photograph Imposter Database. © 2015 IEEE.

AB Face recognition systems have been deployed in many security applications nowadays. Its popularity attracts the attention of an adversary. One of the common methods is to show a photo or video in front of the camera to mislead the detection of the system. In this paper, we propose a face liveness detection method by investigating the focus distance between the face and the background. The focus distance should be the same for the photo or video, while the distance should be different for a real person. The experimental results illustrate that the performance of the detection is improved significantly by using our method in comparison with the one considering the focus distance between the nose and the ear. © 2014 IEEE.

AB Background: There are no previous reports of the incidence rate of intracranial saccular aneurysms in a defined population. Methods: Medical records of all residents of Olmsted County, MN, with a possible intracranial saccular aneurysm (IA) were reviewed. Incidence rates and prevalence of symptomatic and asymptomatic IAs, aneurysmal intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and frequency of IA detection based on size and site were determined. Results: A total of 348 IAs were detected among 270 persons during the 31- year period from 1965 to 1995, including 188 symptomatic patients at presentation (166 with ICH). The age- and sex-adjusted incidence rate for IAs excluding asymptomatic autopsy cases was 9.0/100,000 person-years (P-Y; 95% CI, 7.8 to 10.2). The rate of detection in women (10.7/100,000 P-Y; 95% CI, 8.9 to 12.4) was higher than in men. The highest incidence of IA was among those age 55 to 64 years in men, and 65 to 74 years in women. The incidence rate of aneurysmal ICH was 6.9/100,000 P-Y (95% CI, 5.9 to 8.0). Aneurysms were seven times more likely to be detected in the anterior circulation, and this ratio was not altered significantly by age or gender. On January 1, 1990, the age- and sex-adjusted prevalence rate of identified IAs was 83.4/100,000 population (95% CI, 64.1 to 102.7). Conclusions: This study provides unique data on the population-based incidence and prevalence rates of IAs.

AB Background: Sporadic hemiplegic migraine (SHM) is defined as migraine attacks associated with some degree of motor weakness during the aura phase and where no first-degree relative has identical attacks. SHM has a wide inter- and intraindividual clinical spectrum and, in case of prolonged aura symptoms and disturbed consciousness, can mimic several other acute neurological diseases. Case: In 1996, during his wedding night, a 28-year-old man developed left face, arm and leg weakness, nausea and a throbbing headache. Neurological examination on presentation revealed stupor, fever, meningism and left hemiplegia. There were no abnormalities on emergency magnetic resonance. Lumbar puncture showed mild lymphocytic pleocytosis and slightly elevated protein. He received symptomatic treatment. Subsequent genetic analysis revealed the T666M mutation in the CACNA1A gene of chromosome 19. He was diagnosed with SHM. In 2005, at the end of another episode of hemiplegic migraine (HM), he for the first time developed an episode of paranoid psychosis with anxiety and visual hallucinations. The psychiatric symptoms resolved within a week. Discussion: All perfusion SPECTand transcranial Doppler studies performed in the first days of HM attacks were consistent with hyperemia of the hemisphere contralateral to the neurological signs. FDG-PET/CT in January 2013 revealed a diffusely reduced glucose metabolism of the supratentorial cortex and marked asymmetric hypometabolism of the left cerebellum. The finding of progressive cortical metabolic dysfunction over years appears as a new finding. Glucose hypometabolism may indicate primary neuronal dysfunction as the cause of the prolonged deficits. © 2013 International Headache Society.

AB An effective novel approach of detection and classification of real face image from tampered face image based on second order gradient is proposed in this paper. The intended purpose of proposed approach is to endorse the biometric authentication, by joining the vitality awareness with Facial Recognition Technology (FRT). The proposed method requires only one face image without requirement of additional equipment and easier to implement into existing face recognition technique. For this purpose, real (from own database and some publically available standard database) and tampered (own prepared databases of dummy, color imposed and masked faces) face image database are used here for verification and validation of our assertion. The technique is novel technique and obtained results are initial results which are obtained after applying gradient method and demonstrate that the methodology is very well suited for the discrimination of image of tampered face from the image of real face with accuracy ranges 82.7% ~ 91.7%. This reliable way to detect the mala-fide attack is needed to robustness of the system and it will be able to solve very big real problems of the society when induced in automatic authentication system.

AB Face recognition based on thermal images has minor importance in comparison to visible light spectrum recognition. Nevertheless, in the applications such as liveness detection or fever scan, the thermal face recognition is used as a stand-alone module, or as a part of a multi-modal biometric system. This paper investigates the combinations of many methods, used for thermal face recognition, and introduces some new and modified algorithms, which have not been used in this area yet. Moreover, we show that the choice of the best method is always limited to a certain database (input data). In order to address this problem, the multi-algorithmic biometric fusion based on the logistic regression is deployed. © 2012 Gesellschaft fr Informatik.

AB This panel presentation will provide perspectives of cyber-physical system security of smart grids. As smart grid technologies are deployed, the interconnected nature of these systems is becoming more prevalent and more complex, and the cyber component of this cyber-physical system is increasing in importance. Studying system behavior in the face of failures (e.g., cyber attacks) allows a characterization of the systems' response to failure scenarios, loss of communications, and other changes in system environment (such as the need for emergent updates and rapid reconfiguration). The impact of such failures on the availability of the system can be assessed and mitigation strategies considered. Scenarios associated with confidentiality, integrity, and availability are considered. The cyber security implications associated with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 in the United States are discussed. © 2012 IEEE.

AB RFID has been widely adopted in access control as an identity identification technology. This system can be combined with the face recognition technique to avoid the RFID is used by unauthorized people. However, this approach also suffers a drawback that someone may try to deceive the security system by presenting a photo of the real card owner. In this paper, we propose a method ensuring that such kind of spoof can be rejected. After a frontal face has been detected, the facial object will be tracked by optical flow algorithm until a profile is detected. Experimental results show that the proposed mechanism can improve the validity of the access control system effectively. © 2010 IEEE.

AB Biometric systems have gained the attention of both the research community and the industry becoming an important topic in real application scenarios. Face recognition is, with fingerprint, among the most used techniques since it is natural for humans to recognize people from facial appearance, since the technology is mature, and because, unlike fingerprint, it is completely unintrusive. Existing systems only focus on the appearance of the subjects considering facial expressions as an obstacle to their aim. On the other hand such systems presents several limitations when dealing with variable illumination conditions, head pose, day-to-day variations (e.g. beard, glasses, or make-up), etc. Furthermore, most of the current techniques do not exploit dynamics to detect the liveness of the tested subjects. In this paper we present a study on person recognition from the dynamics of the facial feature points. The aim of this work is to demonstrate that dynamics of facial expressions could be seen as a biometric characteristic. Therefore, only dynamic characteristics are considered and the adopted features are purged of all appearance information. The results clearly show that relevant biometric information can be extracted from facial expressions and other dynamics of the face. © 2009 IEEE.

AB Imbalanced points are image points whose first-order intensity can be clustered into two imbalanced classes. An important property of imbalanced points is that they can be contiguous to each other. The property helps improve the localization accuracy of imbalanced points across imaging variations. Based on this local geometric coherency property, we propose a global-to-local scheme for imbalanced point matching. The proposed matching scheme first builds correspondence between components of coherent imbalanced points and then refines point correspondence within corresponding components. We test the global-to-local matching scheme, compared with several other well-known methods, on a set of groundtruth stereo images. Furthermore, we present a case study of the proposed scheme in face liveness detection. Our results show the promise of the global-to-local matching scheme. ©2009 IEEE.

AB Anti-spoofing protection of biometric systems is always a serious issue in real-life applications of an automatic personal verification system. Despite the fact that face image is the most common way of identifying persons and one of the most popular modalities in automatic biometric authentication, little attention has been given to the spoof resistance of face verification algorithms. In this paper, we discuss how a system based on DCT features with a likelihood-ratio-based classifier can be easily spoofed by adding white Gaussian noise to the test image. We propose a strategy to address this problem by measuring the quality of the test image and of the extracted features before making a verification decision. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.

AB Migraine headaches that occur in the 15- to 30-year-old age group are well documented. In patients in the stroke age bracket, however, who present with a history of neurologic deficit, transient ischemic attacks can be confused with migraine accompaniments. The typical patient is 50 years old, is without a past history of migraines, and complains of scintillating visual disturbances (20 percent), marching paresthesis (22 percent), or a myriad of neurologic deficits. In one series of 70 neurology patients aged over 55 years, 16 percent reported that they experience the new onset of scintillations. Once fully evaluated, the cause of unexplained marching paresthesias, dysphagia, or hemiplegia, once reserved for thrombotic or embolic phenomena, may be attributed to migraine accompaniments. In the face of a normal evaluation, neurologic deficit in the stroke age bracket may be attributed to migraine accompaniments. A case of a 47-year-old woman with sudden onset of left-sided paresthesia, dysarthria, and confusion is presented. The discussion includes a description of migraine pathophysiology and a review of concepts regarding accompaniments.

AB Face recognition is a mainstream biometric authentication method. However, the vulnerability to presentation attacks (a.k.a. spoofing) limits its usability in unsupervised applications. Even though there are many methods available for tackling presentation attacks (PA), most of them fail to detect sophisticated attacks such as silicone masks. As the quality of presentation attack instruments improves over time, achieving reliable PA detection with visual spectra alone remains very challenging. We argue that analysis in multiple channels might help to address this issue. In this context, we propose a multi-channel Convolutional Neural Network-based approach for presentation attack detection (PAD). We also introduce the new Wide Multi-Channel presentation Attack (WMCA) database for face PAD which contains a wide variety of 2D and 3D presentation attacks for both impersonation and obfuscation attacks. Data from different channels such as color, depth, near-infrared, and thermal are available to advance the research in face PAD. The proposed method was compared with feature-based approaches and found to outperform the baselines achieving an ACER of 0.3% on the introduced dataset. The database and the software to reproduce the results are made available publicly. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB Biometric authentication systems are quite vulnerable to sophisticated spoofing attacks. To keep a good level of security, reliable spoofing detection tools are necessary, preferably implemented as software modules. The research in this field is very active, with local descriptors, based on the analysis of microtextural features, gaining more and more popularity, because of their excellent performance and flexibility. This paper aims at assessing the potential of these descriptors for the liveness detection task in authentication systems based on various biometric traits: fingerprint, iris, and face. Besides compact descriptors based on the independent quantization of features, already considered for some liveness detection tasks, we will study promising descriptors based on the joint quantization of rich local features. The experimental analysis, conducted on publicly available data sets and in fully reproducible modality, confirms the potential of these tools for biometric applications, and points out possible lines of development toward further improvements. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB Face recognition has evolved as a prominent biometric authentication modality. However, vulnerability to presentation attacks curtails its reliable deployment. Automatic detection of presentation attacks is essential for secure use of face recognition technology in unattended scenarios. In this work, we introduce a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based framework for presentation attack detection, with deep pixel-wise supervision. The framework uses only frame level information making it suitable for deployment in smart devices with minimal computational and time overhead. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in public datasets for both intra as well as cross-dataset experiments. The proposed approach achieves an HTER of 0% in Replay Mobile dataset and an ACER of 0.42% in Protocol-1 of OULU dataset outperforming state of the art methods. © 2019 IEEE.

TI Face liveness detection using thermal face-CNN with external knowledge

DE Convolutional neural network; External knowledge; Face liveness detection; Thermal image;
AB Face liveness detection is important for ensuring security. However, because faces are shown in photographs or on a display, it is difficult to detect the real face using the features of the face shape. In this paper, we propose a thermal face-convolutional neural network (Thermal Face-CNN) that knows the external knowledge regarding the fact that the real face temperature of the real person is 36~37 degrees on average. First, we compared the red, green, and blue (RGB) image with the thermal image to identify the data suitable for face liveness detection using a multi-layer neural network (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and C-support vector machine (C-SVM). Next, we compared the performance of the algorithms and the newly proposed Thermal Face-CNN in a thermal image dataset. The experiment results show that the thermal image is more suitable than the RGB image for face liveness detection. Further, we also found that Thermal Face-CNN performs better than CNN, MLP, and C-SVM when the precision is slightly more crucial than recall through F-measure. © 2019 by the authors.

AB Conventionally, classifiers designed for face liveness detection are trained on real-world images, where real-face images and corresponding face presentation attacks (PA) are very much overlapped. However, a little research has been carried out in utilization of the combination of real-world face images and face images generated by deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) for face liveness detection. In this paper, we evaluate the adaptive fusion of convolutional-features learned by convolutional layers from real-world face images and deep CNN generated face images for face liveness detection. Additionally, we propose an adaptive convolutional-features fusion layer that adaptively balance the fusion of convolutional-features of real-world face images and face images generated by deep CNN during training. Our extensive experiments on the state-of-the-art face anti-spoofing databases, i.e., CASIA, OULU and Replay-Attack face anti-spoofing databases with both intra-database and cross-database scenarios indicate promising performance of the proposed method on face liveness detection compared to state-of-the-art methods. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB Face recognition is now widely being used to verify the identity of the person in various applications ranging from border crossing to mobile authentication. However, most face recognition systems are vulnerable to spoofing or presentation attacks, where a photo, a video, or a 3D mask of a genuine user's face may be utilized to fool the biometric system. Although many face spoof detection techniques have been proposed, the issue is still unsolved. Recently deep learning based models have achieved impressive results in various challenging image and video classification tasks. Consequently, very few works have applied convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for face liveness detection. Nonetheless, it is still unclear how different CNN features and methods compare with each other for face spoof detection, since prior CNN based face liveness detection approaches employ different fine-tuning procedures and/or datasets for training. Thus, in this paper, an approach based on transfer learning using some well-known and well-adopted pre-trained CNNs architectures is presented. This study explores different deep features and compares them on a common ground for face liveness detection in videos. Experimental analysis on two publicly available databases, NUAA and CASIA-FASD, shows that the proposed method is able to attain satisfactory and comparable results to the state-of-the-art methods. © 2018 IEEE.

AB The widespread use of face recognition algorithms, especially in Automatic Border Control (ABC) systems has raised concerns due to potential attacks. Face morphing combines more than one face images to generate a single image that can be used in the passport enrolment procedure. Such morphed passports have proven to be a significant threat to national security, as two or more individuals that contributed to the morphed reference image can use that single travel document. In this work, we present a novel method based on hybrid colour features to automatically detect morphed face images. The proposed method is based on exploring multiple colour spaces and scale-spaces using a Laplacian pyramid to extract robust features. The texture features corresponding to each scale-space in different color spaces are extracted with Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and classified using a Spectral Regression Kernel Discriminant Analysis (SRKDA) classifier. The scores are further fused using sum rule to detect the morphed face images. Experiments are carried out on a large-scale morphed face image database consisting of printed and scanned images to reflect the real-life passport issuance scenario. The evaluation database consists of images comprised of 1270 bona fide face images and 2515 morphed face images. The performance of the proposed method is compared with seven different deep learning and seven different non-deep learning methods, which has indicated the best performance of the proposed scheme with Bona fide Presentation Classification Error (BPCER) = 0.86% @ Attack Presentation Classification Error Rate (APCER) = 10% and BPCER = 7.59% @ APCER = 5%. The obtained results indicate the robustness in detecting morphing attacks as compared to earlier works. © 2019 IEEE.

AB The main scope of this chapter is to serve as a brief introduction to face presentation attack detection. The next pages present the different presentation attacks that a face recognition system can confront, in which an attacker presents to the sensor, mainly a camera, an artifact (generally a photograph, a video, or a mask) to try to impersonate a genuine user. First, we make an introduction of the current status of face recognition, its level of deployment, and the challenges it faces. In addition, we present the vulnerabilities and the possible attacks that a biometric system may be exposed to, showing that way the high importance of presentation attack detection methods. We review different types of presentation attack methods, from simpler to more complex ones, and in which cases they could be effective. Later, we summarize the most popular presentation attack detection methods to deal with these attacks. Finally, we introduce public datasets used by the research community for exploring the vulnerabilities of face biometrics and developing effective countermeasures against known spoofs. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI Presentation attacks in signature biometrics: Types and introduction t
SO Advances in Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
LA English
DT SER
AB Authentication applications based on the use of biometric methods have received a lot of interest during the last years due to the breathtaking results obtained using personal traits such as face or fingerprint. However, it is important not to forget that these biometric systems have to withstand different types of possible attacks. This work carries out an analysis of different Presentation Attack (PA) scenarios for on-line handwritten signature verification. The main contributions of the present work are: (1) short overview of representative methods for Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) in signature biometrics; (2) to describe the different levels of PAs existing in on-line signature verification regarding the amount of information available to the attacker, as well as the training, effort and ability to perform the forgeries; and (3) to report an evaluation of the system performance in signature biometrics under different PAs and writing tools considering freely available signature databases. Results obtained for both BiosecurID and e-BioSign databases show the high impact on the system performance regarding not only the level of information that the attacker has but also the training and effort performing the signature. This work is in line with recent efforts in the Common Criteria standardization community towards security evaluation of biometric systems, where attacks are rated depending on, among other factors, time spent, effort and expertise of the attacker, as well as the information available and used from the target being attacked. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB To prevent users' privacy from leakage, more and more mobile devices employ biometric-based authentication approaches, such as fingerprint, face recognition, voiceprint authentications, etc., to enhance the privacy protection. However, these approaches are vulnerable to replay attacks. Although state-of-art solutions utilize liveness verification to combat the attacks, existing approaches are sensitive to ambient environments, such as ambient lights and surrounding audible noises. Towards this end, we explore liveness verification of user authentication leveraging users' lip movements, which are robust to noisy environments. In this paper, we propose a lip reading-based user authentication system, LipPass, which extracts unique behavioral characteristics of users' speaking lips leveraging build-in audio devices on smartphones for user authentication. We first investigate Doppler profiles of acoustic signals caused by users' speaking lips, and find that there are unique lip movement patterns for different individuals. To characterize the lip movements, we propose a deep learning-based method to extract efficient features from Doppler profiles, and employ Support Vector Machine and Support Vector Domain Description to construct binary classifiers and spoofer detectors for user identification and spoofer detection, respectively. Afterwards, we develop a binary tree-based authentication approach to accurately identify each individual leveraging these binary classifiers and spoofer detectors with respect to registered users. Through extensive experiments involving 48 volunteers in four real environments, LipPass can achieve 90.21% accuracy in user identification and 93.1% accuracy in spoofer detection. © 2018 IEEE.

AB The vulnerability of biometric identification systems to presentation attacks, also a.k.a. spoof attacks, has received great attention from the biometrics community. Face presentation attacks are particularly easy to fabricate, because face image and videos are easy to obtain from social media, and most face recognition systems rely on 2D RGB image sensors only. To our best knowledge, all the existing face Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) research works focus on solving the problem in a close-set setup, even though it is an open-set problem in real life where Unknown Presentation Attack Detection (UPAD) algorithms are demanded. In this paper, One-Class SVM and AutoEncoder based outliers detection algorithms, are proposed to solve the UPAD problem. It aims to detect the attack presentations from different presentation attack instrument species that are not included in the training and validation set. Both algorithms, together with the state of the art Local Binary Pattern feature are evaluated and compared on four largest face PAD datasets, including the latest Oulu dataset - the largest face PAD dataset so far. Moreover, four UPAD protocols are proposed to evaluate the robustness of the algorithms against environment and device variations. These comprehensive evaluations show that the proposed methods are more accurate on detecting unknown presentation attacks than the state of the art PAD algorithms under complex environment and capturing device variations. © 2018 IEEE.

AB Face recognition is a most widely used and rapidly growing biometric technology. Lot of research has been done in this field, due to its significant applications in various sectors and their influence in our daily life such as securing financial transactions, information security, personal identification and surveillance systems. But face recognition systems are permeable to spoofing attack. The problem of spoofing can be minimized by detecting face liveness which is the main area of concern. Most researchers utilized only eyeblink as liveness indicator to detect face liveness. A novel face liveness detection algorithm with multiple liveness indicators has been proposed in this paper. Eyeblink sequence, lip movement and chin movement are the multiple liveness indicators that have been considered for reliable face liveness detection. Experimental results show that, the proposed method in conjunction with multiple liveness indicators significantly improves the security of face recognition system. The proposed method achieves higher liveness detection rate by detecting photo attack, eye-mouth photo imposter attack and video attack. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB Motion capture-based facial animation has recently gained popularity in many applications, such as movies, video games, and human-computer interface designs. With the use of sophisticated facial motions from a human performer, animated characters are far more lively and convincing. However, editing motion data is difficult, limiting the potential of reusing the motion data for different tasks. To address this problem, statistical techniques have been applied to learn models of the facial motion in order to derive new motions based on the existing data. Most existing research focuses on audio-to-visual mapping and reordering of words, or on photo-realistically matching the synthesized face to the original performer. Little attention has been paid to modifying and controlling facial expression, or to mapping expressive motion onto other 3D characters. This article describes a method for creating expressive facial animation by extracting information from the expression axis of a speech performance. First, a statistical model for factoring the expression and visual speech is learned from video. This model can be used to analyze the facial expression of a new performance or modify the facial expressions of an existing performance. With the addition of this analysis of the facial expression, the facial motion can be more effectively retargeted to another 3D face model. The blendshape retargeting technique is extended to include subsets of morph targets that belong to different facial expression groups. The proportion of each subset included in a final animation is weighted according to the expression information. The resulting animation conveys much more emotion than if only the motion vectors were used for retargeting. Finally, since head motion is very important in adding liveness to facial animation, we introduces an audio-driven synthesis technique for generating new head motion. © 2005 ACM.

AB Vulnerability of recognition systems to spoofing attacks (presentation attacks) is still an open security issue in the biometrics domain. Among all biometric traits, face is exposed to the most serious threat since it is particularly easy to access and reproduce. In this paper, an effective approach against face spoofing attacks based on perceptual image quality assessment features with multiscale analysis is presented. First, we demonstrate that the recently proposed blind image quality evaluator (BIQE) is effective in detecting spoofing attacks. Next, we combine the BIQE with an image quality assessment model called effective pixel similarity deviation (EPSD), which we propose to obtain the standard deviation of the gradient magnitude similarity map by selecting effective pixels in the image. A total number of 21 features acquired from the BIQE and EPSD constitute the multi-scale descriptor for classification. Extensive experiments based on both intradataset and cross-dataset protocols were performed using three existing benchmarks, namely, Replay-Attack, CASIA, and UVAD. The proposed algorithm demonstrated its superiority in detecting face spoofing attacks over many state of the art methods. We believe that the incorporation of the image quality assessment knowledge into face liveness detection is promising to improve the overall accuracy. © 2018 IEEE.

AB Spoofing attacks on biometric systems are one of the major impediments to their use for secure unattended applications. This paper explores features for face liveness detection based on tracking the gaze of the user. In the proposed approach, a visual stimulus is placed on the display screen, at apparently random locations, which the user is required to follow while their gaze is measured. This visual stimulus appears in such a way that it repeatedly directs the gaze of the user to specific positions on the screen. Features extracted from sets of collinear and colocated points are used to estimate the liveness of the user. Data are collected from genuine users tracking the stimulus with natural head/eye movements and impostors holding a photograph, looking through a 2D mask or replaying the video of a genuine user. The choice of stimulus and features are based on the assumption that natural head/eye coordination for directing gaze results in a greater accuracy and thus can be used to effectively differentiate between genuine and spoofing attempts. Tests are performed to assess the effectiveness of the system with these features in isolation as well as in combination with each other using score fusion techniques. The results from the experiments indicate the effectiveness of the proposed gaze-based features in detecting such presentation attacks. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB Shoreline changes are largely dependent on coastal morphology. South-west coast of India is a high energy coast characterised by monsoon high waves, steep beach face and medium-sized beach sand. Waves are generally from west and west south-west during rough monsoon season and from south-west during fair weather season. Shoreline change along this coast is studied with reference to coastal morphological features. Various morphological features, modifications and chronological positions of shoreline are analysed with the information derived from multidated satellite imageries, toposheets and GPS shoreline mapping along with extended field survey. Image processing and GIS techniques have been used for the analysis of data and presentation of results. Sediment accumulation on the leeward side of artificial structures such as harbour breakwaters and groynes is used as a sediment transport indicator. Artificial structures such as seawalls, groynes and harbour breakwaters modify morphology. Shoreline south of headlands/promontories and breakwaters are stable or accreting due to net northerly longshore sediment transport while erosion tendency is observed on the north side. Lateritic cliffs fronting the sea or with seasonal beach undergo slumping and cliff edge retreat as episodic events. Spits adjoining tidal inlets are prone to shoreline variations due to oscillations of inlet mouth. Interventions in the form of inlet stabilization and construction of coastal protection structures trigger erosion along adjoining coasts. Seawalls constructed along highly eroding coasts get damaged, whereas those constructed along monsoon berm crest with frontal beaches for protection against monsoon wave attack are retained. Fishing gaps within seawalls are areas of severe temporary erosion during rough monsoon season. Accretion or erosion accompanies construction of harbour breakwaters in a stable coastal plain. Close dependence of shoreline changes on morphology necessitates detailed understanding of impacts on morphology prior to introducing any intervention in the coastal zone. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB Applicability of the face recognition for smartphone-based authentication applications is increasing for different domains such as banking and e-commerce. The unsupervised data capture of face characteristics in biometric applications on smartphones presents the vulnerability to attack the systems using artefact samples. The threat of presentation attacks (a.k.a spoofing attacks) need to be handled to enhance the security of the biometric system. In this work, we present a new approach of using the raw sensor data. We first obtain the residual image corresponding to noise by subtracting the median filtered version of raw data and then computing simple energy value to detect the artefact based presentations. The presented approach uses simple threshold and thereby overcomes the need for learning complex classifiers which are challenging to work on unseen attacks. The proposed method is evaluated using a newly collected database of 390 live presentation attempts of face characteristics and 1530 attack presentations consisting of electronic screen attacks and printed attacks on the iPhone 6S smartphone.

AB Background: This report describes four cases of cracked tooth syndrome secondary to traumatic occlusion that mimicked trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias. All patients were referred by general practitioners to the Orofacial Pain Clinic at Nihon University Dental School for assessment of atypical facial pain. Clinical Presentation: Case 1: A 51-year-old woman presented with severe pain in the maxillary and mandibular left molars. Case 2: A 47-year-old woman presented with sharp, shooting pain in the maxillary left molars, which radiated to the temple and periorbital region. Case 3: A 49-year-old man presented with sharp, shooting, and stabbing pain in the maxillary left molars. Case 4: A 38-year-old man presented with intense facial pain in the left supraorbital and infraorbital areas, which radiated to the temporoparietal and maxillary regions. All cases mimicked trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, a group of primary headache disorders characterized by unilateral facial pain and ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms. Trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias include cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania, hemicrania continua, and short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing/short-lasting neuralgiform headache attacks with cranial autonomic features. Pulpal necrosis, when caused by cracked tooth syndrome, can manifest with pain frequencies and durations that are unusual for pulpitis, as was seen in these cases. Conclusion: Although challenging, differentiation of cracked tooth syndrome from trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias is a necessary skill for dentists.

AB Audiovisual speech synchrony detection is an important liveness check for talking face verification systems to make sure that the (pre-defined) content and timing of the given audible and visual speech samples match. Nowadays, there exists virtually no technical limitations for combining transferable facial animation and voice conversion (or synthesis) to create an ultimate audiovisual artifact that is able to spoof even advanced random challenge-response based liveness detection. In this study, we investigate the performance of the state-of-the-art text-independent lip-sync detection techniques under presentation attacks consisting of audio recordings of the targeted person and corresponding animated visual speech. Our experimental analysis with three different photo-realistic visual speech animation techniques reveals that generic synchrony models can be fooled even with underarticulated but synchronized lip movements. Thus, measuring audio-video synchrony or content alone is not enough for securing audiovisual biometric systems. Our preliminary findings suggest though that adaptation of person-specific audiovisual speech dynamics is one possible approach to tackle these kinds of high-effort attacks. © 2016 IEEE.

AB In the recent days, the facial biometric system is widely used for the mobile payments and other surveillance systems. Its popularity is going to be increased because of its easiness to use and also it is user friendly. But the main problem in this system is its vulnerability to the spoof attacks made by 2D or 3D face masks or printed photographs. In order to guard against face spoofing, the anti-spoofing methods have been developed to do liveliness detection. In this paper, the different type of face spoofing attacks and the different techniques used for anti-spoofing are analyzed. © 2016 IEEE.

AB Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a unique central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory disease with a broad spectrum of clinical presentations, which are time- and disease progression-related. It usually affects young adults, with a female predominance of 3:1. Men are more likely to develop symptoms at a slightly older age with a more progressive disease course. Diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical, radiological, and laboratory investigations, with a central role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Although the exact etiology is still obscure, the leading hypothesis behind MS relapses is acute inflammatory attacks on CNS myelin and axons. This complex process involves B and T cells together with macrophages and microglia. Genetic and environmental factors are thought to be major contributors to the disease's evolution. MS therapies consist of long-term (immunomodulatory) management, focusing on disease modification, and short-term symptomatic control. Symptomatic treatment includes pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods to protect function and restore quality of life (QoL). The introduction and development of disease-modifying medications provide opportunities to change the face of this disease, enhancing QoL over the long-term. Interferon (INF) and Glatiramer acetate (GLAT) represent first line medications with limited effect and relatively fair safety profile. Newer medications with improved efficacy along with a more hazardous side effect profile are now considered second line therapy. Conclusions The present review summarizes current knowledge of this frequent disease. Urologists must acquire a deeper understanding for better integration of practice recommendations. Neurourol.

DE Bite wound; Complications; Dog bite; Facial wound; Management;
AB The exposed position of the face makes it vulnerable to dog bite injuries. This fact combined with the short stature of children makes them a high-risk group for such attacks. In contrast to wounds inflicted by assaults and accidents, dog bite wounds are deep puncture type wounds compounded by the presence of pathologic bacteria from the saliva of the attacking dog. This, combined with the presence of crushed, devitalized tissue makes these wounds highly susceptible to infection. Key to successful management of such wounds are meticulous cleansing of the wound, careful debridement, primary repair, appropriate antibiotic therapy, and rabies and tetanus immunization where indicated. This review presents an overview of the epidemiology, presentation, management of such emergencies, and the recent advances in the care of such patients. © 2013, Association of Surgeons of India.

AB Face antispoofing has now attracted intensive attention, aiming to assure the reliability of face biometrics. We notice that currently most of face antispoofing databases focus on data with little variations, which may limit the generalization performance of trained models since potential attacks in real world are probably more complex. In this paper we release a face antispoofing database which covers a diverse range of potential attack variations. Specifically, the database contains 50 genuine subjects, and fake faces are made from the high quality records of the genuine faces. Three imaging qualities are considered, namely the low quality, normal quality and high quality. Three fake face attacks are implemented, which include warped photo attack, cut photo attack and video attack. Therefore each subject contains 12 videos (3 genuine and 9 fake), and the final database contains 600 video clips. Test protocol is provided, which consists of 7 scenarios for a thorough evaluation from all possible aspects. A baseline algorithm is also given for comparison, which explores the high frequency information in the facial region to determine the liveness. We hope such a database can serve as an evaluation platform for future researches in the literature. © 2012 IEEE.

AB This paper presents eigenPulse, a new method for human identification from cardiovascular function. Traditional biometric techniques, e.g. face and fingerprint, have used eigen analysis to exploit databases with tens of thousands of entries. One drawback of traditional biometrics is that the credentials, for example, fingerprints, can be forged making the systems less secure. Previous research [S.A. Israel, J.M. Irvine, A. Cheng, M.D. Wiederhold, B.K. Wiederhold, ECG to identify individuals, Pattern Recognition 38(1) (2005) 138-142] demonstrated the viability of using cardiovascular function for human identification. By nature, cardiovascular function is a measure of liveness and less susceptible to forgery. However, the classification techniques presented in earlier work performed poorly over non-standard electrocardiogram (ECG) traces, raising questions about the percentage of the population that can be enrolled. This paper combines the traditional biometrics' use of eigen analysis and previous analysis of cardiovascular function to yield a more robust approach. The eigenPulse processing had a near 100% enrollment rate, with a corresponding higher overall performance. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the past, the Actor Model has mainly been explored in a distributed context. However, more and more application developers are also starting to use it to program shared-memory multicore machines because of the safety guarantees it provides. It avoids issues such as deadlocks and race conditions by construction, and thus facilitates concurrent programming. The tradeoff is that the Actor Model sacrifices expressiveness with respect to accessing shared state because actors are fully isolated from each other (a.k.a. "shared-nothing parallelism"). There is a need for more high level synchronization mechanisms that integrate with the actor model without sacrificing the safety and liveness guarantees it provides. This paper introduces a variation on the communicating event-loops actor model called the TANK model. A tank is an actor that can expose part of its state as a shared read-only resource. The model ensures that any other actor will always observe a consistent version of that state, even in the face of concurrent updates of the actor that owns that state.

AB Illegal users are not permitted to operate within a secure environment. To establish the legality of authentication, the authentication system must perceive and refuse a fake biometric over liveness face authentication. In order to achieve reliable liveness face authentication, the intended purpose of the proposed framework should have two major parts: liveness detection and face authentication. The proposed liveness detection describes illuminative variations on the face, which is especially applicable in artificial shadow estimation; face authentication should also employ a one-against-many classification algorithm based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) to obtain individual subsets, then estimates authenticated performances. Based on experiments on liveness XM2VTS database and photographs from the Google Picasa database, we achieved the liveness accuracy rate of 96.5%, the false rejection rate of 1.17% and the false acceptance rate of 1.69%. © 2008 IEEE.

AB Objective and Importance: To describe the imaging findings of two cases of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) mimicking multiple sclerosis. Clinical Presentation and Intervention: Two cases presenting with neurological signs and symptoms were referred for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation of the brain. Case 1 was a 36-year-old female patient presenting with recurrent headaches and recent onset numbness in the fingers of the right hand. Neurological examination showed a mild sensory deficit in the right hand. Case 2 was a 31-year-old female patient presenting with attacks of right-sided numbness of the face and body. The neurological examination revealed a sensory loss in the face and brisk deep tendon reflexes. Routine MRI sequences showed two types of lesions in both cases: 'punctate' hyperintense lesions on T 2-weighted images (T2WI)/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images, hypointense on T1-weighted images (T 1WI) and 'diffuse' white matter lesions, hyperintense on T 2WI/FLAIR sequences and isointense to hypointense on T1WI. All lesions showed no contrast enhancement. Both cases were previously clinically and radiologically diagnosed as multiple sclerosis. There was a strong family history consistent with recurrent infarctions in other family members of both patients. Both cases were later diagnosed as CADASIL by skin biopsy/genetic linkage studies and follow-up. Conclusion: The cases showed that CADASIL causes stroke-like episodes in adults and can mimic multiple sclerosis on imaging. Clinical evaluation and MRI findings allow a differentiation of the two entities. Copyright © 2006 S. Karger AG.

AB Objective To assess the prevalence of facial pain (V2 and/or V3) presentations among nearly 3,000 patients with headache treated in a university tertiary care center. Methods Between 2010 and 2018, we routinely assessed the prevalence of facial pain presentations of all patients with primary headaches. Results Of 2,912 patient datasets, 291 patients reported facial pain either as an independent or as an additional symptom. Among patients with migraine, 2.3% (44 of 1,935) reported a facial involvement, most commonly in V2. Of these, 18 patients (40.9%) experienced the pain predominantly in the face. In patients with cluster headache, 14.8% (42 of 283) reported a facial involvement, of which 31.0% perceived the pain predominantly in the face. A facial involvement was seen in 45.0% of patients with paroxysmal hemicrania (9 of 20), 21.4% of patients with hemicrania continua (9 of 42), and 20.0% of patients with short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing/short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with cranial autonomic symptoms (3 of 15). In addition, we present 6 patients who reported a constant side-locked facial pain with superseded well-defined facial pain attacks of 10- to 30-minute duration that appeared several times per day. Conclusion Our data suggest that a facial involvement in primary headaches is infrequent but not uncommon. A sole facial presentation of primary headache symptomatology seems to be exceptionally rare. We describe 3 different types of facial pain involvement and, in this context, distinguish patients with paroxysmal orofacial pain syndromes that have not been previously described. These patients may represent a new entity that could tentatively be called constant unilateral facial pain with added attacks. © 2019 American Academy of Neurology.

AB Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is highly prevalent in patients with ischemic stroke. Untreated OSA is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and OSA treatment may improve neurological recovery in stroke survivors, yet OSA in stroke patients remains poorly characterized. The goal of this study is to identify clinical phenotypes of ischemic stroke patients with OSA. Methods: Participants (n = 451) with ischemic strokes and OSA (respiratory-event-index, (REI) ≥ 10/hour based on home sleep apnea testing) were identified from the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project. Latent class analysis was performed based on the following variables: age, sex, race/ethnicity, REI, pre-stroke snoring, pre-stroke tiredness/fatigue, pre-stroke sleep duration, prior stroke history, NIHSS at presentation, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and chronic heart failure. Results: A model with three phenotype clusters provided the best fit. Cluster 1 (n = 55, 12%) was defined by higher NIHSS scores. Participants in cluster 2 (n = 253, 56%) were younger and had relatively low NIHSS scores. Cluster 3 (n = 143, 32%) included participants with severe OSA and higher prevalence of medical comorbidities. Conclusion: Ischemic stroke survivors with OSA can be categorized into three clinical phenotype clusters characterized by differences in stroke severity, OSA severity, age and medical comorbidities. This highlights the heterogeneity of post-stroke OSA. Awareness of the different faces of OSA in patients with ischemic stroke may help clinicians identify OSA in their patients, and inform research concerning the pathophysiology, treatment and prognostic impact of post-stroke OSA. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB It is becoming increasingly easy to automatically replace a face of one person in a video with the face of another person by using a pre-trained generative adversarial network (GAN). Recent public scandals, e.g., the faces of celebrities being swapped onto pornographic videos, call for automated ways to detect these Deepfake videos. To help developing such methods, in this paper, we present the first publicly available set of Deepfake videos generated from videos of VidTIMIT database. We used open source software based on GANs to create the Deepfakes, and we emphasize that training and blending parameters can significantly impact the quality of the resulted videos. To demonstrate this impact, we generated videos with low and high visual quality (320 videos each) using differently tuned parameter sets. We showed that the state of the art face recognition systems based on VGG and Facenet neural networks are vulnerable to Deepfake videos, with 85.62% and 95.00% false acceptance rates (on high quality versions) respectively, which means methods for detecting Deepfake videos are necessary. By considering several baseline approaches, we found the best performing method based on visual quality metrics, which is often used in presentation attack detection domain, to lead to 8.97% equal error rate on high quality Deep-fakes. Our experiments demonstrate that GAN-generated Deepfake videos are challenging for both face recognition systems and existing detection methods, and the further development of face swapping technology will make it even more so. © 2019 IEEE.

AB Face-based biometric recognition systems that can recognize human faces are widely employed in places such as airports, immigration offices, and companies, and applications such as mobile phones. However, the security of this recognition method can be compromised by attackers (unauthorized persons), who might bypass the recognition system using artificial facial images. In addition, most previous studies on face presentation attack detection have only utilized spatial information. To address this problem, we propose a visible-light camera sensor-based presentation attack detection that is based on both spatial and temporal information, using the deep features extracted by a stacked convolutional neural network (CNN)-recurrent neural network (RNN) along with handcrafted features. Through experiments using two public datasets, we demonstrate that the temporal information is sufficient for detecting attacks using face images. In addition, it is established that the handcrafted image features efficiently enhance the detection performance of deep features, and the proposed method outperforms previous methods. © 2019 by the authors.

AB Face recognition based-access systems have been used widely in security systems as the recognition accuracy can be quite high. However, these systems suffer from low robustness to spoofing attacks. To achieve a reliable security system, a well-defined face liveness detection technique is crucial. We present an approach for this problem by combining data of the light-field camera (LFC) and the convolutional neural networks in the detection process. The LFC can detect the depth of an object by a single shot, from which we derive meaningful features to distinguish the spoofing attack from the real face, through a single shot. We propose two features for liveness detection: The ray difference images and the microlens images. Experimental results based on a self-built light-field imaging database for three types of the spoofing attacks are presented. The experimental results show that the proposed system gives a lower average classification error (0.028) as compared with the method of using hand-crafted features and conventional imaging systems. In addition, the proposed system can be used to classify the type of the spoofing attack. © 2019 SPIE and IS and T.

TI Remote blood pulse analysis for face presentation attack detection
SO Advances in Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

DT SER
AB In this chapter, the usage of Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) as a mean for face presentation attack detection is investigated. Remote photoplethysmography consists in retrieving the heart-rate of a subject from a video sequence containing some skin, and recorded at a distance. To get a pulse signal, such methods take advantage of subtle color variation on skin pixels due to the blood flowing through vessels. Since the inferred pulse signal gives information on the liveness of the recorded subject, it can be used for biometric presentation attack detection (PAD). Inspired by work made for speaker presentation attack detection, we propose to use long-term spectral statistical features of the pulse signal to discriminate real accesses from attack attempts. A thorough experimental evaluation, with different rPPG and classification algorithms is carried on four publicly available datasets containing a wide range of face presentation attacks. Obtained results suggest that the proposed features are effective for this task, and we empirically show that our approach performs better than state-of-the-art rPPG-based presentation attack detection algorithms. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB The undeniable convenience of face recognition (FR) based biometrics has made it an attractive tool for access control in various application areas, from airports to remote banking. Widespread adoption of face biometrics, however, depends on the perception of robustness of such systems. One particular vulnerability of FR systems comes from presentation attacks (PA), where a subject A attempts to impersonate another subject B, by presenting, say, a photograph of B to the biometric sensor (i.e., the camera). PAs are the most likely forms of attacks on face biometric systems, as the camera is the only component of the biometric system that is exposed to the outside world. Presentation attack detection (PAD) methods provide an additional layer of security to FR systems. The first edition of the Handbook of Biometric Anti-Spoofing included two chapters on face-PAD. In this chapter we review the significant advances in face-PAD research since the publication of the first edition of this book. In addition to new face-PAD methods designed for color images, we also discuss advances involving other imaging modalities, such as near-infrared (NIR) and thermal imaging. Research on detecting various kinds of attacks, both planar as well as involving three-dimensional masks, is reviewed. The chapter also summarizes a number of recently published datasets for face-PAD experiments. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

DE Component based; Descriptors; Face liveness; Face masks; Face representations; Liveness detection; Low-level features; Spoofing attacks; Biometrics;
AB Spoofing attacks mainly include printing artifacts, electronic screens and ultra-realistic face masks or models. In this paper, we propose a component-based face coding approach for liveness detection. The proposed method consists of four steps: (1) locating the components of face; (2) coding the low-level features respectively for all the components; (3) deriving the high-level face representation by pooling the codes with weights derived from Fisher crite-rion; (4) concatenating the histograms from all components into a classifier for identification. The proposed framework makes good use of micro differences between genuine faces and fake faces. Meanwhile, the inherent appearance differences among different components are retained. Extensive experiments on three published standard databases demonstrate that the method can achieve the best liveness detection performance in three databases. © 2013 IEEE.

AB To counter face presentation attack in face recognition system, the chromatic facial texture differences between the real faces and the facial artefacts are fully analyzed, and chromatic co-occurrence of local binary pattern (CCoLBP) is proposed to investigate the inter-channel based information. Based on the principle of presentation attack and its influence on color component of the face image, a face presentation attack detection (PAD) scheme based on CCoLBP is proposed. By combining intra-channel based facial texture and CCoLBP feature, the differences of color distortion and texture distribution between the real faces and the artefacts are characterized. With these features, the detection is accomplished by using a Softmax classifier. Experiments are done with 5 public databases, and the experimental results and analysis indicate the effectiveness of CCoLBP, and it can achieve good performance in cross-database testing. It has great potential in the application of face PAD with real-time requirement. © 2018 IEEE.

DE Hashtags; Impoliteness; Instagram; Non-apologies; Self-presentation; Social media;
AB Social media play a key role in presentation of the self and management of social relationships. Although self-presentation online has been seen to exhibit a positivity bias, making positive forms of self-presentation more likely than negative ones, there is evidence that linguistic “behaviour” in digitally-mediated communication (DMC) often transgresses norms of appropriateness. This study adds to research on impoliteness in social media by examining the ways in which users of Instagram strategically employ hashtags and engage in face work with potentially inappropriate posts. It presents the results of a quantitative study (512 posts from a random sample) of the content of Instagram posts labelled #sorrynotsorry, as well as a qualitative analysis of politeness strategies accompanying images using the hashtag. It demonstrates how the hashtag is used as a non-apology marker in a balancing act of (im-)politeness and self-presentation strategies that allows for a level of sanctioned face attack. Overall, it suggests that posters on Instagram use #sorrynotsorry in a trans-ideological manner, allowing them to take both oppositional and complicitous stances on evolving norms of appropriateness online. The results add to an understanding of the pragmatics of hashtags in DMC and highlight the strategic nature of self-presentation on social networking sites. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Face liveness detection is a significant research topic in face-based online authentication. The current face liveness detection approaches utilize either static or dynamic features, but not both. In fact, the dynamic and static features have different advantages in face liveness detection. In this paper, we propose a scheme combining dynamic and static features to capture merits of them for face liveness detection. First, the dynamic maps are captured from the inter-frame motion in the video, which investigates motion information of the face in the video. Then, with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the dynamic and static features are extracted from the dynamic maps and the frame images, respectively. Next, in CNN, the fully connected layers containing the dynamic and static features are concatenated to form a fused feature. Finally, the fused features are used to train a binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, which classifies the frames into two categories, i.e. frame with real or fake face. Experimental results and the corresponding analysis demonstrate that the proposed scheme is capable of discovering face liveness by fusing dynamic and static features and it outperforms the current state-of-the-art face liveness detection approaches. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB For face recognition systems, impostors can obtain legal identity authentication by presenting the printed images, the downloaded images or candid videos to the sensor. In this paper, an enhanced face local binary feature (ELBP) of a face map is extracted as a classification feature to identify whether the face map is a real face or a fake face. Compared with the dynamic or static methods proposed in the previous literature, the proposed method is convenient and effective. We achieved over 95% correct recognition rate on NUAA datasets. Through comprehensive analysis and comparison with other static-based algorithms such as M-LBP or LTP, the proposed algorithm can achieve better performances. © 2017 IEEE.

AB Machine learning has been increasingly used in current days. Great improvements, especially in deep neural networks, helped to boost the achievable performance in computer vision and signal processing applications. Although different techniques were applied for deep architectures, the frequency domain has not been thoroughly explored in this field. In this context, this paper presents a new method for extracting discriminative features according to the Fourier analysis. The proposed frequency extractor layer can be combined with deep architectures in order to improve image classification. Computational experiments were performed on face liveness detection problem, yielding better results than those presented in the literature for the grandtest protocol of Replay-Attack Database. This paper also aims to raise the discussion on how frequency domain layers can be used in deep architectures to further improve the network performance. © 2017 IEEE.

AB Alopecia areata (AA) is a T-cell mediated autoimmune disorder in which inflammatory cells attack the hair follicle, resulting in round, well-circumscribed patches of noncicatricial hair loss in normal appearing skin. AA affecting the beard area is well known and is referred to as AA of the beard (BAA) or AA barbae when involvement is limited exclusively to the beard. BAA has been documented in a select number of studies. We review the literature and discuss the clinical features, epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of BAA. Clinical presentation of BAA can vary and manifest as single small areas of hair loss, multiple small or large simultaneous focuses, or total hair loss. Most patients are middle-aged males with focal patches of round or oval hair loss, mostly localized along the jawline. Patches are characteristically well circumscribed and smooth with white hair present at the periphery. Dermoscopic features of BAA include yellow dots, broken hair, and short vellus hairs. BAA may be associated with other autoimmune disorders, including atopic dermatitis, vitiligo, and psoriasis. Many treatment modalities are available for BAA, and selection of a therapy depends on several factors, including disease activity, extent of area affected, duration of disease, and age of the patient. Topical corticosteroids are most commonly used as initial treatment, followed by intralesional steroids. Other therapeutic modalities are discussed. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB Face recognition has been extensively used in a wide variety of security systems for identity authentication for years. However, many security systems are vulnerable to spoofing face attacks (e.g., 2D printed photo, replayed video). Consequently, a number of anti-spoofing approaches have been proposed. In this study, we introduce a new algorithm that addresses the face liveness detection based on the digital focus technique. The proposed algorithm relies on the property of digital focus with various depths of field (DOFs) while shooting. Two features of the blurriness level and the gradient magnitude threshold are computed on the nose and the cheek subimages. The differences of these two features between the nose and the cheek in real face images and spoofing face images are used to facilitate detection. A total of 75 subjects with both real and spoofing face images were used to evaluate the proposed framework. Preliminary experimental results indicated that this new face liveness detection system achieved a high recognition rate of 94.67% and outperformed many state-of-the-art methods. The computation speed of the proposed algorithm was the fastest among the tested methods. © 2017 MVA Organization All Rights Reserved.

AB Face recognition is a widely used biometric technology because it is both user friendly and more convenient to use than other biometric approaches. However, naïve face recognition systems that do not support any type of liveness detection can be easily spoofed using just a photograph of a valid user. Face liveness detection is a key issue in the field of security systems that use a camera. Unfortunately, it is not easy to detect face liveness using existing methods, assuming that there are print failures and overall image blur. With the development of display devices and image capturing technology, it is possible to reproduce face images similar to real faces. Therefore, the number of attacks using a photograph or video displayed on a screen rather than paper will increase. In this study, we compare test results using live faces and high-definition face videos from light-emitting diode (LED) display devices and analyze the changes in face recognition performance according to the lighting direction. Experimental results show that there is no significant difference between live faces and not live faces under good lighting conditions. We suggest the use of gamma to reduce the performance gap between the two faces under poor lighting conditions. From these results, we can provide key solutions to resolve the issues associated with texture-based approaches. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB Biometrics is extensively used for person identification for various security applications. However existing systems using single biometric modality do not provide required level of accuracy and robustness. Combining various biometric modalities has proved to be more efficient in terms of enhancing accuracy. Verification using palm print modality has definitely achieved a great success as a unique and reliable biometric characteristic. Still the demand of robust and highly accurate biometric system can not be fulfilled using only palm print modality. The combined use of palm print and palm vein modality can substantially increase the robustness, anti-spoof capability and accuracy of the system. This paper presents a multimodal biometric identification system based on the fusion of Palm print and Palm vein modalities of the human hand. Here in the first module, the hand image is first preprocessed and its palm print features are extracted using wavelet decomposition technique. Palm vein features are extracted using matched filter technique. For every modality, separate matcher is used for recognition. Decisions obtained by both the matchers are logically ANDed together to recognize the person. Module 1 gives 96% accuracy with zero FAR. In the second module, a rough-to-fine hierarchical feature matching is done for efficient hand recognition. Module 2 gives 97.25% accuracy with very low FAR. © 2016 IEEE.

AB Automatic face recognition plays significant role in biometrics systems, and face spoofing has raised concerns at the same time, since a photo or video of an authorized uesr’s face could be used for deceiving the system. In this paper, we propose a new hierarchical visual feature based on deep learning to discriminate spoof face. First, the LBP descriptor is used to extract low level face features of face images, and then these low level features are encoded to high level features via a deep learning architecture which is consists of sparse auto-encoder (SAE). Finally, SVM classifier is applied to detect face spoofing. We perform a experimental evaluation on two face liveness detection databases, CASIA database and NUAA database. The results indicate the robustness of the proposed approach for face spoofing detection. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.

AB Fingerprint recognition systems are vulnerable to artificial spoof fingerprint attacks, like molds made of silicone, gelatin or Play-Doh. "Liveness detection", which is to detect vitality information from the biometric signature itself, has been proposed to defeat these kinds of spoof attacks. The goal for the LivDet 2009 competition is to compare different methodologies for software-based fingerprint liveness detection with a common experimental protocol and large dataset of spoof and live images. This competition is open to all academic and industrial institutions which have a solution for software-based fingerprint vitality detection problem. Four submissions resulted in successful completion: Dermalog, ATVS, and two anonymous participants (one industrial and one academic). Each participant submitted an algorithm as a Win32 console application. The performance was evaluated for three datasets, from three different optical scanners, each with over 1500 images of "fake" and over 1500 images of "live" fingerprints. The best results were from the algorithm submitted by Dermalog with a performance of 2.7% FRR and 2.8% FAR for the Identix (L-1) dataset. The competition goal is to become a reference event for academic and industrial research in software-based fingerprint liveness detection and to raise the visibility of this important research area in order to decrease risk of fingerprint systems to spoof attacks. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

AB Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is an advanced telecommunication technology which transfers the voice/video over high speed network that provides advantages of flexibility, reliability and cost efficient advanced telecommunication features. Still the issues related to security are averting many organizations to accept VoIP cloud environment due to security threats, holes or vulnerabilities. So, the novel secured framework is absolutely necessary to prevent all kind of VoIP security issues. This paper points out the existing VoIP cloud architecture and various security attacks and issues in the existing framework. It also presents the defense mechanisms to prevent the attacks and proposes a new security framework called Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) using video watermarking and extraction technique and Liveness Voice Detection (LVD) technique with biometric features such as face and voice. IPSs updated with new LVD features protect the VoIP services not only from attacks but also from misuses.

AB Face biometrics plays an important role in various authentication applications. However, one of the main design challenges for an accurate face biometrics is detecting spoof artificial artifacts. The development of robust anti-spoofing algorithm requires for rigorous system training and testing on facial database that includes various possible spoof specimen which reflects different variations of spoofing attacks. Currently, the databases which are used to test face anti-spoofing algorithms are limited in terms of texture variations. Therefore, in this paper, our focus is to introduce a face spoofing database which is compiled from various types of spoofing textures. Our database was collected from 30 different subjects and fake faces were recaptured on various forms which include four different types of paper-based textures and three different digital display devices. All images were collected using a high precision camera device. This database would provide a more realistic and challenging platform for facial anti-spoofing research. © 2014 IEEE.

AB Constantius, as though the Temple of Janus had been closed and all enemies had been laid low, was longing to visit Rome and, following the death of Magnentius, to hold a triumph, without a victory title and after shedding Roman blood. For he did not himself defeat any belligerent nation or learn that any had been defeated through the courage of his commanders, nor did he add anything to the empire, and in dangerous circumstances he was never seen to lead from the front, nor even to be among the front ranks. But he wanted to display an exaggeratedly long procession, standards stiff with gold and the beauty of his attendants, to a population who were living more peacefully, neither anticipating nor wishing to see this or anything like it. For perhaps he was unaware that some earlier emperors had been content with lictors in peacetime, but when the heat of battle could not allow inactivity, one of them had entrusted himself to a small fishing boat, blasted by raging gales, another had followed the example of the Decii and offered up his life in a vow for the state, and another had himself explored the enemy camp alongside the regular soldiers; that, in short, various of them had won renown for magnificent deeds, and so committed their glories to the distinguished memory of posterity. ⋯ When he was approaching the city, observing with a serene expression the respectful attendance of the Senate, and the venerable likenesses of the patrician families, he thought, not like Cineas, the legate of Pyrrhus, that a multitude of kings had been assembled together, but rather that this was the refuge of the whole world [cumque urbi propinquaret, senatus officia, reuerendasque patriciae stirpis effigies, ore sereno contemplans, non ut Cineas ille Pyrrhi legatus, in unum coactam multitudinem regum, sed asylum mundi totius adesse existimabat]. Next, when he turned his gaze to the general populace, he was astonished at the speed with which every type of men from everywhere had flowed into Rome. As though he were trying to terrify the Euphrates or the Rhine with the sight of arms, with the standards in front of him on each side, he sat alone in a golden chariot, glittering with the shimmer of many different precious stones, whose flashes seemed to produce a flickering light. After many others had preceded him, he was surrounded by dragons, woven from purple cloth and affixed to the golden, bejewelled tips of spears, open to the wind with their broad mouths and so hissing as though roused with anger, trailing the coils of their tails in the wind [eumque post antegressos multiplices alios, purpureis subtegminibus texti, circumdedere dracones, hastarum aureis gemmatisque summitatib

TI Eléments apologétiques chez victor de vita: Exemple d’un genre lit
SO Shifting Genres in Late Antiquity
LA English
DT CHAP
AB This chapter analyses the literary genre of Victor of Vita's Historia Persecutionis Africanae provinciae. It argues that Victor's text is a hybrid one, since it presents the characteristics of three distinct literary genres – historiography, hagiography and apologia. These characteristics were required by the author's intentions in compiling the Historia, as also by his perception of contemporary events. Indeed, the mysterious author of Vita regards the Vandals as indisputable persecutors and constructs a plot around the events that he describes as a repetition of past persecutions, especially the Great Persecution under Diocletian. Victor deploys certain characteristics that belong to hagiography in order to represent the Vandals as persecutors, as also some elements of the historiographical genre in order to ensure the credibility of his narrative. His presentation of documents, such as the royal edicts, for example, recalls Eusebius’ Church history, which Victor undoubtedly knew through the translation of Rufinus. His borrowings from the apologetic genre can also be explained by his perception of contemporary events as the repetition of past persecutions. The author thus, quite logically, resorts to the literary genre that had helped the Christians of the first four centuries overcome Roman intolerance and to galvanise the Christian communities against attacks by the Roman state. For Victor the only possible option in response to Vandal intolerance was to rally the ‘troops’ to face the assault, just like the Christians of earlier centuries. This chapter provides an example of the adaptation of literary genres to the new realities of Late Antiquity – the replacement of the dichotomy pagan/Christian with that of ‘barbarian’-heretic/Roman-Christian. Moreover, Victor offers an instance of the survival and transformation of a genre – apologia – usually associated with the first centuries of the Christian era and little studied in the context of Late Antiquity. © Geoffrey Greatrex and Hugh Elton 2015.

AB Face liveness detection aims to distinguish genuine faces from disguised faces. Most previous works under visible light focus on classification of genuine faces and planar photos or videos. To handle the threedimensional (3-D) disguised faces, liveness detection based on multispectral images has been shown to be an effective choice. In this paper, a gradient-based multispectral method has been proposed for face liveness detection. Three feature vectors are developed to reduce the influence of varying illuminations. The reflectance-based feature achieves the best performance, which has a true positive rate of 98.3% and a true negative rate of 98.7%. The developed methods are also tested on individual bands to provide a clue for band selection in the imaging system. Preliminary results on different face orientations are also shown. The contributions of this paper are threefold. First, a gradient-based multispectral method has been proposed for liveness detection, which considers the reflectance properties of all the distinctive regions in a face. Second, three illumination-robust features are studied based on a dataset with two-dimensional planar photos, 3-D mannequins, and masks. Finally, the performance of the method on different spectral bands and face orientations is also shown in the evaluations. © Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

AB Background Cluster headache is a primary headache disorder characterized by periodic episodes of intense headache accompanied by autonomic symptoms. We report an unusual clinical presentation of cluster headache that was preceded by myoclonus and accompanied by hemiparesis. Case Report A 26-year-old man visited hospital due to recurrent jerky movements on the left side of his face and neck area lasting 3 days. These jerky movements had disappeared spontaneously without specific treatment. On the 10th day after onset of the jerky movements, the patient developed a series of unilateral severe headaches that were accompanied by autonomic symptoms lasting 1-2 hours. According to the second edition of The International Classification of Headache Disorders, he was diagnosed as having cluster headache. Two of the 16 severe headache attacks this patient suffered were accompanied by dysarthria and hemiparesis. Electroencephalography performed during hemiparesis revealed diffuse lateralized slow activity on the ipsilateral hemisphere of the headache side. The headache and accompanying hemiparesis disappeared after medical treatment for cluster headache. Conclusions We describe a case of cluster headache accompanied by hemiparesis, which was preceded by myoclonus. We also outline the possible mechanisms underlying this case. © 2012 Korean Neurological Association.

AB INTRODUCTION: A rare but significant cause for stroke is sub-intimal carotid dissection and this mechanism accounts for approximately 2.5% of all strokes.1 Dissection of the carotid artery is often caused by trauma to the face or neck.2 Under 45 years old, it is the second leading cause of stroke.3 Neurological symptoms can be lacking or subtle, therefore the condition may be overlooked but the pathological processed is believed to be attributed to thromboembolism.4 Microemboli in the middle cerebral artery, are known as a risk factor for ischaemic stroke following a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and can be detected by transcranial Doppler examination (TCD).5 The established treatment regime is antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation or both along with supportive therapy.6 Current evidence suggests managing microemboli in both crescendo TIA's and post carotid endarterectomy improves outcome.7 We have found the use of Tirofiban, a potent intravenous antiplatelet agent currently licensed for use in acute coronary syndrome, effective in the treatment of microemboli in this manner.7 CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of symptomatic carotid artery dissection post radical neck dissection, causing TCD detected microemboli and successfully treated with Tirofiban. CONCLUSION: We believe further study into the use of Tirofiban in the treatment of microemboli after carotid dissection is indicated. © 2011 Surgical Associates Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: Herpes simplex virus type 1 encephalitis presents acutely in patients who are immunocompetent. We report what we believe to be the first published case of a subacute course of herpes simplex virus type 1 encephalitis in a patient with asymptomatic chronic lymphocytic leukemia who subsequently developed multiple sclerosis. Case presentation: A 49-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of fever blisters presented to the emergency department with a history of left temporal headache for four weeks, and numbness of the left face and leg for two weeks. A complete blood count revealed white blood cell count of 11,820 cells/mL, with an absolute lymphocyte count of 7304 cells/mL. The cerebrospinal fluid contained 6 white blood cells/L, 63 red blood cells/L, 54 mg glucose/dL, and 49 mg total protein/dL. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed meningoencephalitis and bilateral ventriculitis. Cerebrospinal fluid polymerase chain reaction for herpes simplex virus type 1 was positive, and the patient's symptoms resolved after ten days of treatment with parenteral aciclovir. Incidental findings on peripheral blood smear and flow cytometry testing confirmed chronic lymphocytic leukemia. One month later, she developed bilateral numbness of the hands and feet; a repeat cerebrospinal fluid polymerase chain reaction for herpes simplex virus type 1 at this time was negative. A repeat magnetic resonance imaging scan showed an expansion of the peri-ventricular lesions, and the cerebrospinal fluid contained elevated oligoclonal bands and myelin basic protein. A brain biopsy revealed gliosis consistent with multiple sclerosis, and the patient responded to treatment with high-dose parenteral steroids. Conclusion: Herpes simplex virus type 1 encephalitis is a rare presentation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Our patient had an atypical, subacute course, presumably due to immunosuppression from chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This unusual case of herpes simplex virus type 1 encephalitis emphasizes the importance of T cell function in diseases of immune dysregulation and autoimmunity such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple sclerosis. It raises the question of whether atypical presentations of herpes simplex virus encephalitis warrant deliberations on immunocompetence. The development of multiple sclerosis in our patient so soon after she received treatment for herpes simplex virus type 1 encephalitis raises the possibility that herpes simplex virus type 1 encephalitis in an immunosuppressed patient may trigger multiple sclerosis. © 2011 Singhal and Corman; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB Clustered applications in storage area networks (SANs), widely adopted in enterprise datacenters, have traditionally relied on distributed locking protocols to coordinate concurrent access to shared storage devices. We examine the semantics of traditional lock services for SAN environments and ask whether they are sufficient to guarantee data safety at the application level. We argue that a traditional lock service design that enforces strict mutual exclusion via a globally-consistent view of locking state is neither sufficient nor strictly necessary to ensure application-level correctness in the presence of asynchrony and failures. We also argue that in many cases, strongly-consistent locking imposes an additional and unnecessary constraint on application availability. Armed with these observations, we develop a set of novel concurrency control and recovery protocols for clustered SAN applications that achieve safety and liveness in the face of arbitrary asynchrony, crash failures, and network partitions. Finally, we present and evaluate Minuet- a new synchronization primitive based on these protocols that can serve as a foundational building block for safe and highly-available SAN applications. © 2009 USENIX Association.

AB The scientific aspects of automatic procedures of precise facial composites synthesis, ophthalmic geometry pattern extraction/ interpretation as well as based on these ones the Test of Person/Personality Liveness are proposed. Main research idea is that two relatively novel phenomena (functional asymmetry of left/right brain hemispheres and ophthalmic geometry pattern), are contained sufficient information of different scales for biometrics person recognition, psychological personality type definition, some biologic, artistic/ sculptural, artificial intelligent applications; it means that appropriate entities can be quantitatively tested. Moreover, it is possibly to testing whether person/ personality are biological or virtual ones. The mentioned information is poorly distinguished by human being but may automatic be extracted with computer from frontal facial image and/or interpreted in biometrics or modern psychology terms. Symmetry, as wide or narrow as you may define its meaning, is one idea by which man through the ages has tried to comprehend and create order, beauty, and perfection. - Hermann Weil Our notion of symmetry is de rived form the human face. Hence, we demand symmetry horizontally and in breadth only, not vertically nor in depth. - Blasé Pascal © 2007 IEEE.

AB Spoofing face recognition systems with photos or videos of someone else is not difficult. Sometimes, all one needs is to display a picture on a laptop monitor or a printed photograph to the biometric system. In order to detect this kind of spoofs, in this paper we present a solution that works either with printed or LCD displayed photographs, even under bad illumination conditions without extra-devices or user involvement. Tests conducted on large databases show good improvements of classification accuracy as well as true positive and false positive rates compared to the state-of-the-art. © 2011 IEEE.

AB Despite the impressive progress in face recognition, current systems are vulnerable to presentation attacks, which subvert the face recognition systems by presenting a face artifact. Several techniques have been developed to automatically detect different presentation attacks, mostly for 2D photo print and video replay attacks. However, with the development of 3D modeling and printing technologies, 3D mask has become a more effective way to attack the face recognition systems. Over the last decade, various detection methods for 3D mask attacks have been proposed, but there is no survey yet to summarize the advances. We present a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art approaches in 3D mask spoofing and anti-spoofing, including existing databases and countermeasures. In addition, we quantitatively compare the performance of different mask spoofing detection methods on a common ground (i.e., using the same database and evaluation metric). The effectiveness of several 2D presentation attack detection methods is also evaluated on two 3D mask spoofing databases to show whether they are applicable or not for 3D mask attacks. Finally, we present some insights and summarize open issues to address in the future. © 2019

AB The increased need for unattended authentication in multiple scenarios has motivated a wide deployment of biometric systems in the last few years. This has in turn led to the disclosure of security concerns specifically related to biometric systems. Among them, presentation attacks (PAs, i.e., attempts to log into the system with a fake biometric characteristic or presentation attack instrument) pose a severe threat to the security of the system: any person could eventually fabricate or order a gummy finger or face mask to impersonate someone else. In this context, we present a novel fingerprint presentation attack detection (PAD) scheme based on i) a new capture device able to acquire images within the short wave infrared (SWIR) spectrum, and ii) an in-depth analysis of several state-of-the-art techniques based on both handcrafted and deep learning features. The approach is evaluated on a database comprising over 4700 samples, stemming from 562 different subjects and 35 different presentation attack instrument (PAI) species. The results show the soundness of the proposed approach with a detection equal error rate (D-EER) as low as 1.35% even in a realistic scenario where five different PAI species are considered only for testing purposes (i.e., unknown attacks). © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB Face anti-spoofing has become a vital element for guaranteeing the security of face recognition systems. Previous face anti-spoofing approaches generally exploit cues in visible light images or near-infrared images individually. Few studies pay attention to fusing visible light and near-infrared images for face anti-spoofing. However, the strengths and weaknesses of visible light images and near-infrared images for face anti-spoofing can be complementary. In this study, we introduce a new face anti-spoofing dataset named as CIGIT-PPM, which includes paired visible light and near-infrared images with spoofing medium, distance, pose, expression and session variations for both print and 3D mask attacks. Further, we propose a novel fusing paired visible light and near-infrared spectral images CNN based approach for face anti-spoofing, combining the discriminating ability of both visible light and near-infrared spectral images. Specifically, an end-to-end CNN is employed to learn fusing representation from paired images and do classification at multilevel, and then weight averaged strategy is utilized to integrate the classification probability of different levels, which gives the final result that the input paired images are captured from a live face or a spoof face. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on self-collected dataset CIGIT-PPM and public dataset msspoof. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The identification which uses biological characteristics has been a current top in the recent past. However, numerous spoofing skills occur with the rising prosperity of advance recognition technology, especially in the detection and recognition of a face. In allusion to the problem above, more robust and accurate face spoofing detection schemes have been put forward. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated extraordinary success in face liveness detection recently. In this study, an effective face anti-spoofing detection method based on CNN and rotation invariant local binary patterns (RI-LBP) has been proposed. First, the authors use CNN to extract deep features and use RI-LBP to extract colour texture features. In addition, the principal component analysis approach is employed to decrease the dimensions of deep characteristic. Moreover, two different features are fused before applying to support vector machine (SVM). Finally, the SVM classifier is adopted to identify genuine faces from fake faces. They have conducted extensive experiments to obtain a scheme of better generalisation capability for face anti-spoofing detection. The analysis results indicate that the proposed approach implements great generalisation capability over other state-of-the-art approaches within the intra-databases and cross-databases. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2019.

AB Combination of multiple information extracted from different biometric modalities in multimodal biometric recognition system aims to solve the different drawbacks encountered in a unimodal biometric system. Fusion of many biometrics has proposed such as face, fingerprint, iris…etc. Recently, electrocardiograms (ECG) have been used as a new biometric technology in unimodal and multimodal biometric recognition system. ECG provides inherent the characteristic of liveness of a person, making it hard to spoof compared to other biometric techniques. Ear biometrics present a rich and stable source of information over an acceptable period of human life. Iris biometrics have been embedded with different biometric modalities such as fingerprint, face and palm print, because of their higher accuracy and reliability. In this paper, a new multimodal biometric system based ECG-ear-iris biometrics at feature level is proposed. Preprocessing techniques including normalization and segmentation are applied to ECG, ear and iris biometrics. Then, Local texture descriptors, namely 1D-LBP (One D-Local Binary Patterns), Shifted-1D-LBP and 1D-MR-LBP (Multi-Resolution) are used to extract the important features from the ECG signal and convert the ear and iris images to a 1D signals. KNN and RBF are used for matching to classify an unknown user into the genuine or impostor. The developed system is validated using the benchmark ID-ECG and USTB1, USTB2 and AMI ear and CASIA v1 iris databases. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms unimodal biometric system. A Correct Recognition Rate (CRR) of 100% is achieved with an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 0.5%. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB Over the past few years, Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) has become a fundamental part of facial recognition systems. Although much effort has been devoted to anti-spoofing research, generalization in real scenarios remains a challenge. In this paper we present a new open-source evaluation framework to study the generalization capacity of face PAD methods, coined here as face-GPAD. This framework facilitates the creation of new protocols focused on the generalization problem establishing fair procedures of evaluation and comparison between PAD solutions. We also introduce a large aggregated and categorized dataset to address the problem of incompatibility between publicly available datasets. Finally, we propose a benchmark adding two novel evaluation protocols: one for measuring the effect introduced by the variations in face resolution, and the second for evaluating the influence of adversarial operating conditions. © 2019 IEEE.

TI Multi-adversarial discriminative deep domain generalization for face p
SO 32nd IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, C

DE Biometrics; Vision Applications and System;
AB Face presentation attacks have become an increasingly critical issue in the face recognition community. Many face anti-spoofing methods have been proposed, but they cannot generalize well on 'unseen' attacks. This work focuses on improving the generalization ability of face anti-spoofing methods from the perspective of the domain generalization. We propose to learn a generalized feature space via a novel multi-adversarial discriminative deep domain generalization framework. In this framework, a multi-adversarial deep domain generalization is performed under a dual-force triplet-mining constraint. This ensures that the learned feature space is discriminative and shared by multiple source domains, and thus is more generalized to new face presentation attacks. An auxiliary face depth supervision is incorporated to further enhance the generalization ability. Extensive experiments on four public datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2019 IEEE.

AB Biometry-based authentication systems are potential candidates to replace traditional username and password-based access schemes. Facial recognition is becoming widely popular, and many existing devices already include embedded cameras, making this technology easy to use. Nevertheless, facial recognition systems are prone to security breaches, such as facial spoofing attacks, where a impostor tries to gain access to the system by disguising him/herself as a genuine user. The goal of this paper is to propose a countermeasure capable of detecting unauthorized access attempts in facial recognition systems. Most authors uses only the face to detect facial spoofing attacks. However, we argue that more information available in the training data found on Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) datasets should be used, specially when adopting deep learning schemes. We show that using the full frame captured by the camera is more reliable than using only the face since the environment presents rich information that is useful to differentiate a genuine access from an impostor. We present a deep learning method that uses the entire frame instead of just the face to detect presentation attacks. The preliminary experimental results are encouraging, and based on a GoogLeNet architecture, the detection of such attacks potentially can be obtained in more than 96% of the test cases. © 2019 IEEE.

AB Even though biometric technology increases the security of systems that use it, they are prone to spoof attacks where attempts of fraudulent biometrics are used. To overcome these risks, techniques on detecting liveness of the biometric measure are employed. For example, in systems that utilise face authentication as biometrics, a liveness is assured using an estimation of blood flow, or analysis of quality of the face image. Liveness assurance of the face using real depth technique is rarely used in biometric devices and in the literature, even with the availability of depth datasets. Therefore, this technique of employing 3D cameras for liveness of face authentication is underexplored for its vulnerabilities to spoofing attacks. This research reviews the literature on this aspect and then evaluates the liveness detection to suggest solutions that account for the weaknesses found in detecting spoofing attacks. We conduct a proof-of-concept study to assess the liveness detection of 3D cameras in three devices, where the results show that having more flexibility resulted in achieving a higher rate in detecting spoofing attacks. Nonetheless, it was found that selecting a wide depth range of the 3D camera is important for anti-spoofing security recognition systems such as surveillance cameras used in airports. Therefore, to utilise the depth information and implement techniques that detect faces regardless of the distance, a 3D camera with long maximum depth range (e.g., 20 m) and high resolution stereo cameras could be selected, which can have a positive impact on accuracy. © 2019 by the authors.

AB Face recognition is a popular and efficient form of biometric authentication used in many software applications. One drawback of this technique is that it is prone to face spoofing attacks, where an impostor can gain access to the system by presenting a photograph of a valid user to the sensor. Thus, face liveness detection is a necessary step before granting authentication to the user. In this paper, we have developed deep architectures for face liveness detection that use a combination of texture analysis and a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the captured image as real or fake. Our development greatly improved upon a recent approach that applies nonlinear diffusion based on an additive operator splitting scheme and a tridiagonal matrix block-solver algorithm to the image, which enhances the edges and surface texture in the real image. We then fed the diffused image to a deep CNN to identify the complex and deep features for classification. We obtained 100% accuracy on the NUAA Photograph Impostor dataset for face liveness detection using one of our enhanced architectures. Further, we gained insight into the enhancement of the face liveness detection architecture by evaluating three different deep architectures, which included deep CNN, residual network, and the inception network version 4. We evaluated the performance of each of these architectures on the NUAA dataset and present here the experimental results showing under what conditions an architecture would be better suited for face liveness detection. While the residual network gave us competitive results, the inception network version 4 produced the optimal accuracy of 100% in liveness detection (with nonlinear anisotropic diffused images with a smoothness parameter of 15). Our approach outperformed all current state-of-the-art methods. © 2019 by the authors.

AB The vulnerability of face recognition systems to presentation attacks (also known as direct attacks or spoof attacks) has received a great deal of interest from the biometric community. The rapid evolution of face recognition systems into real-time applications has raised new concerns about their ability to resist presentation attacks, particularly in unattended application scenarios such as automated border control. The goal of a presentation attack is to subvert the face recognition system by presenting a facial biometric artifact. Popular face biometric artifacts include a printed photo, the electronic display of a facial photo, replaying video using an electronic display, and 3D face masks. These have demonstrated a high security risk for state-of-the-art face recognition systems. However, several presentation attack detection (PAD) algorithms (also known as countermeasures or antispoofing methods) have been proposed that can automatically detect and mitigate such targeted attacks. The goal of this survey is to present a systematic overview of the existing work on face presentation attack detection that has been carried out. This paper describes the various aspects of face presentation attacks, including different types of face artifacts, state-of-the-art PAD algorithms and an overview of the respective research labs working in this domain, vulnerability assessments and performance evaluation metrics, the outcomes of competitions, the availability of public databases for benchmarking new PAD algorithms in a reproducible manner, and finally a summary of the relevant international standardization in this field. Furthermore, we discuss the open challenges and future work that need to be addressed in this evolving field of biometrics. 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

AB To review researcher‟s attempts in response to the problem of spoofing and liveness detection, mapping the research overview from the literature survey into a suitable taxonomy, exploring the basic properties of the field, motivation of using liveness detection methods in face recognition, and Problems that may restrain the advantages. We presented a subjected search on face recognition with liveness detection and its synonyms in four main databases: Web of science, Science Direct, Scopus and IEEE Xplore. We believe that these databases are widely inclusive enough to cover the literature. The final number of articles considered is 65 articles. 4 of them where review and survey articles that described a general overview about liveness detection and anti-spoofing methods. Since 2012, and despite of leaving some areas unestablished and needs more attention, researchers tried to keep track of liveness detection in several ways. No matter what their category is, articles concentrated on challenges that faces the full utility of anti-spoofing methods and recommended some solutions to overcome these challenges. In this paper, different types of liveness detection and face antispoofing techniques are investigated to keep researchers updated with what is being developed in this field.

AB Face recognition is essential for a wide range of technologies that requires person identification. Due to the presence of spoof face attacks, an additional layer of security is needed to protect the system, which can be provided by liveness detection. In this paper we develop a technique for discriminating live from fake images. Our approach is based upon the hypothesis that spoofing scheme leave statistical indication or structure in images which can be utilized for detection by assistance of image quality features. To achieve this, image quality measures (IQMs) statistical evaluation has been implemented using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) technique. A feature set of measures with highest discrimination power to distinguish between real and fake images was obtained. This ensures the simplicity of detection system and improves its computational efficiency. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.

AB Virtual classroom is one of the fastest growing educational technologies used by many industries and institutions. Today, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) cloud is become a most accepted replacement to different virtual classroom technologies such as internet chat, internet radio, web conferencing, traditional video conferencing and peer to peer VoIP calls. It provides greater flexibility, reliability and cost efficient telecommunication features and operates on comparatively lesser bandwidth. Involvement of new technology in virtual classroom makes it more reliable to teachers and students. Still it follows traditional methods to monitor students by invigilator whether it may be inside the classroom or home study. A secure framework for virtual classroom is developed to not only monitor student’s activities continuously but also the amount of time spent by each student and provide security against unsecure unauthorized login. An effective monitoring System based on Liveness Face Detection techniques is proposed to add more flexibility to conduct virtual classroom and also increases the level of securities of each student’s accounts. © 2018 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB Ear recognition has received broad attention from the biometric community and its emerging usage in multiple applications is raising new security concerns, with robustness against presentation attacks being a very active field of research. This paper addresses for the first time the ear presentation attack detection problem by developing an exhaustive benchmarking study on the performance of state-of-the-art light field and non-light field based ear presentation attack detection solutions. In this context, this paper also proposes an appropriate ear artefact database captured with a Lytro ILLUM lenslet light field camera, including both 2D and light field contents, using several types of presentation attack instruments, including laptop, tablet and two different mobile phones. Results show very promising performance for two recent light field based presentation attack detection solutions originally proposed for face presentation attack detection. © EURASIP 2018.

AB Presentation attacks against Face Recognition System (FRS) have incrementally posed challenges to create new detection methods. Among the various presentation attacks, disguise attacks allow concealing the identity of the attacker thereby increasing the vulnerability of the FRS. In this paper, we present a new approach for attack detection in multi-spectral systems, where face disguise attacks are carried out. The approach is based on using spectral signatures obtained from a spectral camera operating in eight narrow spectral bands across the Visible (VIS) and Near Infra-Red (NIR) (530nm to 1000nm) spectrum and learning deeply coupled auto-encoders. The robustness of the proposed approach is validated using a newly collected spectral face database of subjects conducting both bona fide (i.e. Real) presentations and disguise attack presentations. The database is designed to capture 2 different kinds of attacks from 54 subjects, amounting to a total number of 6480 samples. Extensive experiments carried on the multi-spectral face database indicate the robust performance of proposed scheme when benchmarked with three different state-of-the-art methods. © 2018 IEEE.

AB In the last years several works have been focused on the impact of new sensors on face recognition. A particular interest has been addressed to technologies able to detect the depth of the scene as light field cameras. Together with person identification algorithms, new anti-spoofing methods customized for specific devices have to be investigated. In this paper, a new algorithm for presentation attack detection on light field face database is proposed. While distance between subject and camera is not a relevant information for standard 2D spoofing attacks, it could be important when using 3D cameras. We prove through three experiments that the proposed method based on depth map elaboration outperforms the existent algorithms in presentation attack detection on light field images. © 2018 Gesellschaft fuer Informatik.

AB Due to their advantages, facial recognition systems are among the most widely used biometric systems in recent years. However, their drawback is that they can easily be deceived by using 3D masks, which are replicas of real faces. To confirm this fact, we have tested the vulnerability to 3D masks attacks of the already approved Legendre moments invariants (LMI)-based face recognition method. This has been achieved by using the 3D mask attack database (3DMAD), which consists of real faces and faces with 3D masks. The obtained spoof false acceptance rate (SFAR) was close to 65%, which proves that this recognition system is vulnerable to 3D masks attacks. This is generally the case of other face recognition systems, with no anti-spoofing provision. In this paper, a face recognition method is proposed to prevent hackers from deceiving face recognition systems by using 3D masks of people belonging to the system database. This method combines the LMI and the linear discriminant analysis for characteristic features extraction, and the maximum likelihood for classification. With a 97.6% recognition rate and a SFAR equal to 0.83%, the results obtained may be considered as very satisfactory. These results, while obtained with a lower computational time, compare favorably with those of the state-of-the-art method that uses the same 3DMAD database. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB In this contribution, we propose to tackle the face presentation attack detection (PAD) problem by using features derived from a pulse signal obtained through remote photoplesthymography (rPPG). Recent studies show that the pulse signal provides information on the liveness of a subject; hence it can be used to identify whether a recorded video sequence originates from a genuine user or is an attack. Inspired by work made for speaker presentation attack detection, we propose to use long-term spectral statistical features of the pulse signal to discriminate real accesses from attack attempts. Experiments are performed on different, publicly available databases and following associated protocols. Obtained results suggest that the proposed features are effective for this task, and we empirically show that our approach performs better than state-of-the-art rPPG-based presentation attack detection algorithms. © 2018 IEEE.

AB Biometrie systems suffer from a fundamental vulnerability to presentation attacks which impairs their security and robustness. To overcome this issue, liveness detection methods have been introduced to ensure that input data is originating from a live human being, and it is not forged from old or artificial data. In case of fingerprint and face image-Two of the most widely used traits in biometric systems-liveness detection methods attempts to detect fake input data such as gummy finger or finger image in the former, and printed face image or masks in the latter. A new trend in liveness detection methods is moving toward using bio-electrical signals such as Electrocardiography (ECG) and Electroencephalography (EEG). These signals are believed to have an intrinsic liveness property due to the point that they can only be obtained when a live human subject is present. However this is not a realistic assumption, since in recent works these signals have been artificially crafted, and gotten accepted by biometric systems. Therefore, similar to other traits, liveness detection methods for bio-electrical signals need to be developed, and, furthermore new approaches to liveness detection should be studied. In this paper, we discuss liveness detection challenges, and trade-offs with respect to factors such as usability, cost, and performance, and necessary requirements for an evaluation criteria is specified. Finally, the current state of art in liveness detection methods are comprehensively evaluated using the developed criteria. © 2017 IEEE.

AB Face recognition systems have been improved rapidly in re cent decades. However, their wide deployment has been hindered by their vulnerability to spoofing attacks. In this paper, we present a challenge and response method to detect attack in face recognition systems by recording the gaze of a user in response to a moving stimulus. The proposed system extracts eye centres in the capturedframes and computes features from these landmarks to ascertain whether the gaze aligns with the challenge trajectory in order to detect spoofing attacks. The system is tested using a new database simulating mobile device use with 70 subjects attempting three types of spoof attacks (projected photo, looking through a 2D mask or wearing a 3D mask). Evaluations on the collected database show that the proposed approach performs favourably when compared with state-of-the-art methods. © 2018 IEEE.

AB Many trait-specific countermeasures to face spoofing attacks have been developed for security of face authentication. However, there is no superior face anti-spoofing technique to deal with every kind of spoofing attack in varying scenarios. In order to improve the generalization ability of face anti-spoofing approaches, an extendable multi-cues integration framework for face anti-spoofing using a hierarchical neural network is proposed, which can fuse image quality cues and motion cues for liveness detection. Shearlet is utilized to develop an image quality-based liveness feature. Dense optical flow is utilized to extract motion-based liveness features. A bottleneck feature fusion strategy can integrate different liveness features effectively. The proposed approach was evaluated on three public face anti-spoofing databases. A half total error rate (HTER) of 0% and an equal error rate (EER) of 0% were achieved on both REPLAY-ATTACK database and 3D-MAD database. An EER of 5.83% was achieved on CASIA-FASD database. © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Concurrency is beginning to be accepted as a core knowledge area in the undergraduate CS curriculum—no longer isolated, for example, as a support mechanism in a module on operating systems or reserved as an advanced discipline for later study. Formal verification of system properties is often considered a difficult subject area, requiring significant mathematical knowledge and generally restricted to smaller systems employing sequential logic only. This paper presents materials, methods and experiences of teaching concurrency and verification as a unified subject, as early as possible in the curriculum, so that they become fundamental elements of our software engineering tool kit—to be used together every day as a matter of course. Concurrency and verification should live in symbiosis. Verification is essential for concurrent systems as testing becomes especially inadequate in the face of complex non-deterministic (and, therefore, hard to repeat) behaviours. Concurrency should simplify the expression of most scales and forms of computer system by reflecting the concurrency of the worlds in which they operate (and, therefore, have to model); simplified expression leads to simplified reasoning and, hence, verification. Our approach lets these skills be developed without requiring students to be trained in the underlying formal mathematics. Instead, we build on the work of those who have engineered that necessary mathematics into the concurrency models we use (CSP, π -calculus), the model checker (FDR) that lets us explore and verify those systems, and the programming languages/libraries (occam-π, Go, JCSP, ProcessJ) that let us design and build efficient executable systems within these models. This paper introduces a workflow methodology for the development and verification of concurrent systems; it also presents and reflects on two open-ended case studies, using this workflow, developed at the authors’ two universities. Concerns analysed include safety (don’t do bad things), liveness (do good things) and low probability deadlock (that testing fails to discover). The necessary technical background is given to make this paper self-contained and its work simple to reproduce and extend. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB Smartphone based facial biometric systems have been well used in many of the security applications starting from simple phone unlocking to secure banking applications. This work presents a new approach of exploring the intrinsic characteristics of the smartphone camera to capture a number of stack images in the depth-of-field. With the set of stack images obtained, we present a new feature-free and classifier-free approach to provide the presentation attack resistant face biometric system. With the entire system implemented on the smartphone, we demonstrate the applicability of the proposed scheme in obtaining a stack of images with varying focus to effectively determine the presentation attacks. We create a new database of 13250 images at different focal length to present a detailed analysis of vulnerability together with the evaluation of proposed scheme. An extensive evaluation of the newly created database comprising of 5 different Presentation Attack Instruments (PAI) has demonstrated an outstanding performance on all 5 PAI through proposed approach. With the set ofcomplementary benefits of proposed approach illustrated in this work, we deduce the robustness towards unseen 2D attacks. © 2017 IEEE.

AB Background and Purpose-The Australian Stroke Foundation ran annual paid advertising between 2004 and 2014, using the FAST (Face, Arm, Speech, Time) campaign from 2006 and adding the message to call emergency medical services in 2007. In this study, we examined temporal trends in emergency medical services use and referrals from general practitioners in the Australian state of Victoria to evaluate the impact of these campaigns. Methods-Using data from 33 public emergency departments, contributing to the Victorian Emergency Minimum Dataset, we examined trends in emergency department presentations for 118 000 adults with an emergency diagnosis of stroke or transient ischemic attack between 2003 and 2015. Annual trends were examined using logistic regression using a precampaign period (January 2003 to August 2004) as reference and adjusting for demographic variables. Results-Compared with the precampaign period, significant increases in emergency medical services use were seen annually between 2008 and 2015 (all P<0.001, eg, 2015; adjusted odds ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.10-1.23). In contrast, a decrease was seen in patients presenting via general practitioners across all campaign years (all P<0.001, eg, 2015; adjusted odds ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.44-0.53). Conclusions-Since the Stroke Foundation campaigns began, a greater proportion of stroke and transient ischemic attack patients are presenting to hospital by emergency medical services and appear to be bypassing their general practitioners. © 2018 American Heart Association, Inc.

The ability to resist spoofing attacks has not been addressed until recently. While a number of researchers has thrown themselves into the challenging mission of developing effective liveness detection methods against this kind of threat, the existing algorithms are usually affected by limitations such as light conditions, response speed and interactivity. In this paper, a novel and appealing approach is introduced based on the joint analysis of visible image and near-infrared image of faces, three different features (bright pupil, HOG in nose area, reflectance ratio) are extracted to form the final BPNGR feature vector. A SVM classifier with RBF kernel is trained to distinguish between genuine (live) and spoof faces. Experiment results on the self-collected database with 605 samples clearly demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous systems in terms of speed and accuracy. © 2018, Society for Imaging Science and Technology.

AB With the growing deployment of face recognition system in recent years, face anti-spoofing has become increasingly important, due to the increasing number of spoofing attacks via printed photos or replayed videos. Motivated by the powerful representation ability of deep learning, in this paper we propose to use CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) to learn multiple deep features from different cues of the face images for anti-spoofing. We integrate temporal features, color based features and patch based local features for spoof detection. We evaluate our approach extensively on publicly available databases like CASIA FASD, REPLAY-MOBILE and OULU-NPU. The experimental results show that our approach can achieve much better performance than state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, 2.22% of EER (Equal Error Rate) on the CASIA FASD, 3.2% of ACER (Average Classification Error Rate) on the OULU-NPU (protocol 1) and 0.00% of ACER on the REPLAY-MOBILE database are achieved. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.

AB In day to day, the Object Liveness Detection for Genuine Face recognition becoming a challenging task in security systems which is important in many real time applications such as User Authentication, Object Identification, Object Recognition, Object live detection, genuine face identification and many more. From many decades, the existing systems and proposed systems for Genuine Object Face recognition and Anti-Spoofing Classifier is accomplished to detect liveness of the object with the help of object features and finds spoofing attacks on all subjects. However, by considering the various individual differences between several objects, the ordinary classifier cannot simplifies well to all objects. In order to overcome this problem, we proposed a Combined HOG-LPQ with Fuz-SVM classifier for Object Liveness Detection, allows to select specific object based on Region of Interest (ROI) and extract features of ROI, so that it will reduce the complexity in feature extraction and then recognises face, later on it check for spoofing attacks using Fuzzy logic based SVM classifier which is specifically trained for each object, and also avoids the interferences between several objects. In addition of all possible rare and uncommon fake samples, the proposed system also includes blur objects. The proposed Combined HOG-LPQ with Fuz-SVM classifier for Object Liveness Detection makes it practical to train well performed individual Object to its certain face with liveness detection. We performed experiments on various real time objects with exiting data base; the details are discussed in the prospect of the proposed approach. © 2017 IEEE.

AB Biometric recognition, which is an integral part of the present-day security solutions, faces a major threat from presentation or spoofing attacks. In this paper, we present a novel presentation attack detection (PAD) approach for dorsal hand-vein based recognition system. The proposed approach performs Laplacian of Gaussian filtering on the acquired images, followed by extraction of histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) features at multiple scales. A linear SVM is employed for each scale and the final decision is obtained by combining individual decisions using the majority voting scheme. Experiments were carried out on 624 real images and 624 artefacts (spoof samples) collected from left and right hands of 52 subjects. Artefacts were generated independent of the enrollment images, by employing an off-the-shelf smartphone camera to capture the vein patterns from users' hands. These images were displayed using two different display devices and presented as artefacts to the biometric sensor. The experiments were carried out in the same-device and the cross-device scenarios. Our approach achieves average error rate of 0.16% and 0.8% in the same-device and the cross-device experiments, respectively and outperforms local binary patterns (LBP) based baseline algorithm. © 2017 MVA Organization All Rights Reserved.

AB Due to the significant development of the internet and communications, a huge amount of data is sent and received every day through this network, the evil face of this evolution is the security of these data. The 3D presentation is a type of these data that needs to be secured, where these data used in a confidential issue like GIS maps. Also, it costs a lot of money and time to produce the 3D presentation like the data which generated by CAD. This paper presents a blind 3D watermarking technique that prevents the 3D data from illegal piracy and guarantees the authentication of these data, and the technique used the spherical coordinates of the vertices of the model to embed the watermark using a random table as a key to makes it more secure. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is giving pretty immeasurable imper-ceptibility compared with other techniques likewise is robust against different non-noxious attacks, for example, Similarity transformation, cropping, subdivision, and simplification. © 2017 IEEE.

AB Entity authentication is one of the fundamental information security properties for secure transactions and communications. The combination of biometrics with cryptography is an emerging topic for authentication protocol design. Among the existing biometrics (e.g., fingerprint, face, iris, voice, heart), the heart-signal contains liveness property of biometric samples. In this paper, a remote entity authentication protocol has been proposed based on the randomness of heart biometrics combined with chaos cryptography. To this end, initial keys are generated for chaotic logistic maps based on the heart-signal. The authentication parameters are generated from the initial keys that can be used for claimants and verifiers to authenticate and verify each other, respectively. In this proposed technique, as each session of communication is different from others, therefore many session-oriented attacks are prevented. Experiments have been conducted on sample heart-signal for remote authentication. The results show that the randomness property of the heart-signal can help to implement one of the famous secure encryption, namely one-time pad encryption. © 2017 IEEE.

AB In the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, anti-Muslim discourse and sentiment has become pervasive in the West. Using a collaborative ethnographic approach, we observe how participants at a Turkish Community Center (TCC) cultivate stigma management strategies against the cultural backdrop of post-9/11 anti-Muslim stereotypes. In our analysis, we use Goffman’s work on stigma and critical race theory to explore the socially embedded nature of stigmatization processes for Turkish Muslims in a local community center. Our findings reveal how aspects of Turkish culture and Islam, together with a structural context that facilitates collective stigma management, allow TCC participants to effectively manage stigma and combat anti-Muslim stereotypes. Turkish participants use the practice of “dialogue” to prioritize secular identity(ies) through cultural education, normalize the Muslim self in conversation about religion, and embody a gendered presentation of Islam and Turkish culture. While facilitating individual and collective resilience for TCC participants in the face of stigmatization and pervasive anti-Muslim sentiment, these practices also contribute to the reproduction of broader patterns of racial, cultural, and gender inequality. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.

AB Internet-motivated video streaming systems face such complicated issues as a high degree of network-resource sharing amongst many flows, which potentially leads to deadlocks. Using siphons and their corresponding dangerous markings, this work investigates a method to enforce control iteratively. At each iteration, a generalized mutual exclusion constraint is produced to keep only those markings under which liveness is enforced. Furthermore, a generalized elementary siphon control method is proposed such that the final supervisor is structurally simple. Examples are used to illustrate the proposed approach. © 2006 IEEE.

AB Biometric Systems gained attention in all over the world because of its reliability and user friendly approach. In contrast to these advantages, these biometric systems are highly fence less to fraudulent attacks via fake self manufactured, synthetic or reconstructed samples which is particular problem of biometrics. To ensure the security of biometric system, needs to develop a novel method which reduce the vulnerability. Here, we proposed a novel software based method based on liveness detection system to detect the real and fake samples by using Image Quality Assessment(IQA) for multiple biometric system achieving the objective enhancing the security level of biometric recognition framework. For experimental results, real and dummy database of fingerprint and face has been taken. From one image, 14 image quality measures has been determined which helps in distinguishing the real and fake samples. The proposed system is fast, user-friendly, provides high performance, non-invasive in nature and having low cost and highly competitive than other state of the art approaches. After analysis of the image quality of real and fake biometric samples, it conveys the valuable information which efficiently helps in distinguishes them from fake samples.

AB By analyzing the difference of facial texture features between living face and photo, we propose a novel face anti-spoofing algorithm based on gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and dual-tree complex wavelet tree (DT-CWT). Firstly, inspired by the co-occurrence matrix, we extract five texture features including angle second moment, entropy, contrast, correlation and local uniformity to represent the gray direction, interval and amplitude information for the face texture information. Secondly, DT-CWT has the advantages of approximate translation invariance and good direction selectivity. Therefore, the coefficients of DT-CWT can enhance the texture information and edge information in the frequency domain. At last, the SVM classification is used to distinguish between true and fake face. Our algorithm is demonstrated on the published NUAA database. Compared with the existing methods, the feature dimension is reduced. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm improves the detection accuracy. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB Introduction Dog bites are common and can affect victims of different ages, from children to the elderly. Injuries are usually located in different body regions, including head and face. The treatment of choice for injuries is the suture of the lesion, accompanied by antibiotic therapy and tetanus and anti-rabies vaccination. Presentation of case An 11-year-old male black patient was admitted to the Surgery and Maxillo-Facial Traumatology Service, on an urgent basis, victim of domestic animal aggression (dog biting). The child had multiple and extensive lesions on the face, trauma with laceration with loss of substance, involving the left genic region, lower and upper lip, and lower gingival-labial sulcus. Discussion Smaller children are especially vulnerable to injuries in the craniofacial region due their low stature, propensity to crawl/play on the ground and exploratory behavior. The primary treatment of bites is by means of direct suture, grafting or local flaps, depending on the type of wound and the surgeon's decision, regardless of time elapsed from the attack. Conclusion This case shows a case of a child patient victim of animal bite, with lesions limited to the region of the face. The patient was followed up for a month and showed good wound healing without any complications. © 2017

AB A presentation attack consists in submitting to the fingerprint capture device an artificial replica of the finger of the targeted client. If the sensor is not equipped with an appropriate algorithm aimed to detect the fingerprint spoof, the system processes the obtained image as a one belonging to a real fingerprint. In order to face this problem, several presentation attacks detection (PAD) algorithms have been proposed so far. Current methods heavily rely on features extracted from a large data set of fake and real fingerprint images, and an appropriate classifier trained with such data to distinguish between live (real) and fake (spoof) fingerprint images. Building such data set requires a significant effort for fabricating samples of fake fingerprints, with the most effective materials used to circumvent the sensor. Interesting and promising results have been obtained, but they also suggest that the PAD is tailored on the particular sensor. Small and significant differences also occur when a novel version of the same sensor is released, and this may affect the PAD. Therefore, making a PAD interoperable is among the main current issues when considering fingerprints as the first level of protection and security of logical or physical resources. This paper is a first attempt to assess at which extent the sensor interoperability can be an issue for fingerprint PADs and to eventually propose a solution to this limitation. In particular, textural features will be under focus and a feature space transformation method based on the least square is proposed. Copyright © 2017 for this paper by its authors.

AB Human recognition has been an active research area in the past decade. As the traditional biometrics such as face, fingerprint and iris have been widely deployed around the world, the vulnerability of such systems to falsification and spoofing attacks has been admitted. ECG is related to electrical activities of heart and is among the newer additions to biometric family. In addition to its inherent liveness detection, it is easy to collect. It can be easily captured from fingertips. However, ECG is a time-varying signal. Unlike most of previous works on ECG biometric that are limited to rest condition, we consider the effect of exercise on biometric performance of ECG. We consider the case that enrollment and testing are in different body conditions: rest and exercise. A feature selection is conducted to select features that are less affected by exercise. Selected features are then used for enrolling and testing the biometric system's users. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art methods in ECG recognition. © 2016 IEEE.

AB Nowadays face recognition system usage is increasing day by day to provide better security mechanism. But with the face recognition system, there are some spoofing methods also attached using which the system can be befooled easily. These attacks are simple and easy as they cost less and the images can also be easily retrieved from social sites; therefore there are high chances of them to be successful. . Still there is a scarcity of a productive anti-spoofing algorithm to resolve this issue. The aim of this paper is to present a method which can be used for identification of the spoof. A method is proposed which takes the live video streaming input from the user and perform Liveness detection on the user based on the eye blinking movement and for face feature extraction Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) is used as it proves to be an effective feature descriptor in the face recognition. Two classifiers k Nearest Neighbour (kNN) and Neural Network (NN) are used for the classification purpose. The work is performed on the self created Database and implementation is performed in MATLAB for better understanding, visualization and programming. The performance results of the kNN and NN classifier are compared and finally it is concluded that which classifier outperforms the other one. ©2016ACM.

AB In a typical transmission control protocol and Internet protocol (TCP/IP) suite, there are several ways, such as using photograph, three-dimensional (3D) model, and video clip of a valid user to mock the facial recognition. Studies show that there has been significant improvement in detecting photograph and 3D model spoofing. However, there is no such improvement in detecting video spoofing. Recent studies suggest that liveness monitoring using the facial features has potential to improve security, especially in biometric systems. In this paper, a liveness monitoring technique is introduced to assist facial recognition. In the proposed system, an eye blinking pattern is used through a real-time generic web-camera. An eye blinking password system using ultrasonic range sensing module is developed for liveness detection of the users. The system is tested by conducting experiments using 15 valid users and 100 different user appearances. According to the experimental results, the proposed system achieves 99% face recognition accuracy and 99% liveliness detection performance. © 2015 IEEE.

AB The interactive liveness detection for fact recognition often requires users to read some digits from 0 to 9. The movement and variation of lip texture during reading potentially provide discriminative information for human identification. This paper firstly addressed the issue of whether the lip texture during reading can serve as a soft-biometric for person identification. Different from the traditional lip recognition methods that are based on color statistics and lip shapes, we develop a deep architecture that incorporates both CNN and LSTM to jointly model the appearance and the spatial-Temporal information of lip texture. We also build a new lip recognition database that contains 11,123 videos for the number 0∼9 in Chinese from 57 people. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve 96.01% on close-set protocols, suggesting the usage of lip texture as soft-biometrics for facilitating face recognition. © 2016 IEEE.

AB We propose a novel face liveness detection method by analyzing the sparse structure information in 3D space based on binocular vision and texture information based on LBP (Local Binary Patterns). Structures of real faces have regular 3D structure information while structures of fake faces are usually presented in plane version or curve version different from real faces. Besides, fake faces containing quality defects caused by the printing technology can be detected by using the LBP texture feature. Three liveness detectors utilizing the 3D structure acquired from the binocular vision system, LBP and the combination of the aforementioned two methods are evaluated on a database. Experimental results show that the proposed methods can efficiently distinguish photo and real face. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.

There are three approaches to perform liveness detection: by challenge and response based liveness detection technique, by face texture liveness detection and by joining two or more biometrics liveness detection. The existing techniques fail to give good results for Face Liveness Detection under unconstrained environment. Hence we have proposed Face Liveness Detection based on Image Quality Assessment (IQA) parameters.

AB Resisting spoofing attempts via photographs and video playbacks is a vital issue for the success of face biometrics. Yet, the "liveness" topic has only been partially studied in the past. In this paper we are suggesting a holistic liveness detection paradigm that collaborates with standard techniques in 2D face biometrics. The experiments show that many attacks are avertible via a combination of antispoofing measures. We have investigated the topic using real-time techniques and applied them to real-life spoofing scenarios in an indoor, yet uncontrolled environment. © 2008 IEEE.

AB With the growth of biometric technology, spoofing attacks have been emerged a threat to the security of the system. Main spoofing scenarios in the face recognition system include the printing attack, replay attack, and 3D mask attack. To prevent such attacks, techniques that evaluating liveness of the biometric data can be considered as a solution. In this paper, a novel face liveness detection method based on cardiac signal extracted from face is presented. The key point of proposed method is that the cardiac characteristic is detected in live faces but not detected in non-live faces. Experimental results showed that the proposed method can be effective way for determining printing attack or 3D mask attack. © 2016 SPIE.

AB Authentication is the process of identifying and verifying someone, who it claims to be known as user. The increasing popularity of smart mobile phones provides user to store personal data and user information. It is necessary to ensure the confidential access of the mobile phone to its user. Currently, Face Unlock is the biometric user authenticating system widely available in mobile phone. However, user's face image for authentication could not be considered as a secure. Since we faced the problem of 2D face spoofing attacks by displaying user photo in front of the camera. In this paper, we analyze on current methods of face recognition for authentication on mobile phone and present a novel approach for Face Recognition system to be more secure and convenient use. We perform by acquiring with various angular of face information from user and analyze the liveness detection of user by comparing with biometric template of data acquired in a database. The results to the user face recognition are promising in liveness detection and reliable against spoofing. © 2014 IEEE.

AB Based on gaze estimation, we propose an effective person-specific spoofing detection method to counter replay attack using a noninvasive challenge and response technique. The points on the computer screen create the challenge, and the gaze positions of the user as they look at the computer screen form the response. Firstly, face identification is conducted to recognize identity. Secondly, gaze estimation model is trained for each subject by adaptive linear regression with incremental learning and used to predict gaze positions when user is looking at the computer screen. Finally, difference between predicted gaze positions and system point locations is used as fake score to evaluate the liveness of user. Our basic assumption is that a genuine access can be attacked by salient objects and follow them. Therefore, the lower the fake score is, the more probable the user is genuine. Experimental results show that proposed method obtains competitive performance in distinguishing replay attacks from genuine accesses. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB Face recognition is a critical tool used in almost all major biometrics based security systems. But recognition, authentication and liveness detection of the face of an actual user is a major challenge because an imposter or a non-live face of the actual user can be used to spoof the security system. In this research, a robust technique is proposed which detects liveness of faces in order to counter spoof attacks. The proposed technique uses a three-dimensional (3D) fast Fourier transform to compare spectral energies of a live face and a fake face in a mathematically selective manner. The mathematical model involves evaluation of energies of selective high frequency bands of average power spectra of both live and non-live faces. It also carries out proper recognition and authentication of the face of the actual user using the fringe-adjusted joint transform correlation technique, which has been found to yield the highest correlation output for a match. Experimental tests show that the proposed technique yields excellent results for identifying live faces. © 2015 SPIE.

AB Periocular injuries from dog bites are relatively common in school-age children, but intraocular trauma is exceedingly rare. We present a 7-year-old boy who sustained a zone 3 ruptured globe injury after attack by a Perro de Presa Canario. At presentation, visual acuity in the injured eye was counting fingers. Surgical exploration revealed an inferotemporal corneoscleral laceration extending 15 mm posterior to the limbus, with protrusion of uveal tissue, which was repaired. Visual acuity improved to 20/40 by the first postoperative month. Copyright © 2015 by the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus.

AB Virtualization is becoming a prominent field of research not only in distributed systems, but also in software protection and obfuscation. Software virtualization has given rise to advanced techniques that may provide intellectual property protection and anti-cloning resilience. We present results of an empirical study that answers whether integrity of execution can be preserved for process-level virtualization protection schemes in the face of adversarial analysis. Our particular approach considers exploits that target the virtual execution environment itself and how it interacts with the underlying host operating system and hardware. We give initial results that indicate such protection mechanisms may be vulnerable at the level where the virtualized code interacts with the underlying operating system. The resolution of whether such attacks can undermine security will help create better detection and analysis methods for malware that also employ software virtualization. Our findings help frame research for additional mitigation techniques using hardware-based integration or hybrid virtualization techniques that can better defend legitimate uses of virtualized software protection.

AB Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterised by attacks of self-limited swelling affecting extremities, face and intra-abdominal organs, most often caused by mutations in the C1-inhibitor gene with secondary Bradykinin-mediated increased vascular permeability. We describe a 36-year-old man with a history of HAE who presented with painful interdigital bullae secondary to an acute oedema exacerbation. Biopsy and cultures of the lesions were negative and they resolved spontaneously. It is important to highlight and recognise the development of oedema blisters after resolution of a flare of HAE (only 1 previous case report), and hence avoid unnecessary dermatological diagnostic workup and treatment.

AB With the development of E-Commerce, biometric based on-line authentication is more competitive and is paid more attentions. It brings about one of hot issues of liveness detection recently. In this paper, we propose a liveness detection scheme to combine Fourier statistics and local binary pattern (LBP). First, The Gamma correction and DoG filtering are utilized to reduce the illumination variation and to preserve the key information of the image. Then the Fourier statistics and LBP are combined together to form a new feature vector. Finally, a SVM classifier is trained to discriminate the live and forge face image. The experimental results on the NUAA demonstrate that the proposed scheme is efficient and robust. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

AB The vulnerability of face recognition systems is a growing concern that has drawn the interest from both academic and research communities. Despite the availability of a broad range of face presentation attack detection (PAD) (or countermeasure or antispoofing) schemes, there exists no superior PAD technique due to evolution of sophisticated presentation attacks (or spoof attacks). In this paper, we present a new perspective for face presentation attack detection by introducing light field camera (LFC). Since the use of a LFC can record the direction of each incoming ray in addition to the intensity, it exhibits an unique characteristic of rendering multiple depth (or focus) images in a single capture. Thus, we present a novel approach that involves exploring the variation of the focus between multiple depth (or focus) images rendered by the LFC that in turn can be used to reveal the presentation attacks. To this extent, we first collect a new face artefact database using LFC that comprises of 80 subjects. Face artefacts are generated by simulating two widely used attacks, such as photo print and electronic screen attack. Extensive experiments carried out on the light field face artefact database have revealed the outstanding performance of the proposed PAD scheme when benchmarked with various well established state-of-the-art schemes. © 2015 IEEE.

AB Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare premature aging disease, caused by a de novo mutation of lamin-A gene, LMNA G608G. Accumulation of abnormal lamin-A (progerin) compromises nuclear membrane integrity and results in the accelerated senescence. Affected patients show a typical feature of birdlike face, alopecia, sclerotic skin, loss of subcutaneous fat, and short stature with advancing years. Neonatal scleroderma is the first presentation, although early diagnosis is challenging. The leading cause of death is cardio-/cerebro-vascular accidents associated with atherosclerosis. However, not all findings may recapitulate the aging process. We herein report a 9-year-old Japanese male with HGPS who developed cerebral infarction. The genetic study of peripheral blood-derived DNA determined a heterozygous c.1824C>T mutation, p.G608G. Telomere length of lymphocytes was normal. Bilateral stenosis of carotid siphons was prominent, while systemic arteriosclerosis was unremarkable assessed by the ankle-brachial index, carotid ultrasound imaging and funduscopic study. HGPS patients have marked loss and functional defects in vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to the vulnerability to circulatory stress. Symmetrical stenosis of siphons might occur as a distinctive cerebral vasculopathy of HGPS, rather than simple vascular senescence. Peripheral blood study on LMNA G608G and telomere length could screen progerias in infancy for early therapeutic intervention. © 2012 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology.

AB We report the case of a 35-year-old man admitted due to heart failure, who had had moderate cognitive deficit, craniofacial dysmorphism, epilepsy, panic attacks and congenital heart disease (subvalvular aortic stenosis) associated with chronic atrial fibrillation since childhood. In view of his facial dysmorphism and clinical presentation, karyotype analysis was performed and revealed a de novo interstitial deletion in chromosome 8 in the region p23.1-p23.2. This is a rare chromosomal anomaly (about 50 descriptions in the literature), whose most common manifestations include heart defects, cognitive retardation and behavioral disturbances. In this paper we present the first case with associated subvalvular aortic stenosis and review the literature on this chromosomal abnormality. © 2012 Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia.

AB This panel presentation will provide perspectives of resiliency as it relates to smart grids. As smart grid technologies are deployed, the interconnected nature of these systems is becoming more prevalent and more complex, and while resilience is expected to be enhanced, the presence of common mode failures will thwart the ability of the smart grid to achieve full levels of resilience. Studying system behavior in the face of failures (e.g., cyber attacks) allows a characterization of the systems' response to failure scenarios, loss of communications, and other changes in system environment (such as the need for emergent updates and rapid reconfiguration). The impact of such failures on the availability of the system can be assessed and mitigation strategies considered. This panel will consider measures to identify and eliminate common mode failure mechanisms that might be present in the deployment of smart grid systems. © 2012 IEEE.

TI Honest brokers: The politics of expertise in the "who Lost China?" Deb
SO Social Problems

DE China; Communism; Expertise; Politics; Reputation;
AB Complex social systems require knowledge specialists who provide information that political actors rely on to solve policy challenges. Successful advice is unproblematic; more significant is assigning institutional blame in the aftermath of advice considered wrong or harmful, undercutting state security. How do experts, operating within epistemic communities, preserve their reputation in the face of charges of incompetence or malice? Attacks on experts and their sponsors can be an effective form of contentious politics, a wedge to denounce other institutional players. To examine the politics of expertise we analyze the debate in the early 1950s over "Who Lost China?," the congressional attempt to assign responsibility for the fall of the Nationalist regime to the Communists. Using a "strong case," we examine political battles over the motives of Professor Owen Lattimore. For epistemic authority an expert must be defined as qualified (having appropriate credentials), influential (providing consequential information), and innocent (demonstrating epistemic neutrality). We focus on two forms of attack: Smears (an oppositional presentation of a set of linked claims) and degradation ceremonies (the institutional awarding of stigma). We differentiate these by the critic's links to systems of power. Smears appear when reputational rivals lack power to make their claims stick, while degradation ceremonies operate through dominance within an institutional setting. Policy experts are awarded provisional credibility, but this access to an autonomous realm of knowledge can be countered by opponents with alternate sources of power. Ultimately expertise involves not only knowledge, but also the presentation of a validated self. © 2011 by Society for the Study of Social Problems, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we propose a binocular framework for face liveness verification under unconstrained localization. The proposed framework contains two components: the first component localizes imbalanced points in face regions of an input pair of stereo images and the second component detects whether an imaging face is a 2D object or a 3D object. We test the propose framework on a publicly available stereo face database, which demonstrated its potential. © 2010 IEEE.

AB While techniques such as biometric face recognition observe facial landmarks and local texture for identification and verification, temporal variability and long term impact of aging reduce recognition accuracy considerably. Facial bone and moreover dental structures, are, however, both exposed directly and much less variable and are routinely used in forensic applications. We propose to use novel optical and ultrasound signal acquisition mechanisms to obtain non-invasive images of dental structures avoiding issues associated with radiographic techniques and review the persistent features of the oral cavity and their suitability to biometric recognition with a view to long-term stability and amenability to detection and liveness testing. © 2009 IEEE.

AB We proposed a iris recognition system using the rotation spreading neural network (R-SAN net). The R-SAN net correctly recognized the orientation of iris images using the iris pattern alone, not the positional arrangement of respective face parts. The orientation recognition performance of R-SAN net allows the accurate compensation of the orientation variation. For the characteristics of the iris pattern recognition, the equal error rate was 0.79%, which was investigated with iris images acquired from 19 subjects. On the other hand, the liveness detection method using a variation in the brightness of an iris pattern induced by a pupillary reflex was developed. The live and artificial irises were classified by a decision threshold of 3.7% brightness variation rate. ©2009 IEEE.

AB Three cases of internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection due to trivial trauma were reported. A 14-year-old, previously healthy, girl developed left hemiparesis after jogging. MRI showed cerebral infarction in the right basal ganglia and the MR angiography (MRA) revealed luminal narrowing of the right ICA as well as pseudolumen at the origin of the right ICA. She was treated with antithrombotic therapy. Follow-up MRA demonstrated normal signal in the right ICA. A 23-year-old woman admitted to the hospital because of minor facial injury due to a traffic accident. Although she had no apparent symptom, follow-up CT, one day after presentation, showed cerebral infarction in the right basal ganglia. Angiography showed diminished luminal diameter of the right ICA. She was treated with antithrombotic therapy and follow-up angiography showed reconstitution of normal lumina of the right ICA. A 34-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of transient ischemic attack following swimming. Neurological examination was normal and MRI did not show any ischemic lesion. MRA revealed diminished signal in the left ICA as well as string and pearl sign at the origin of the left ICA. She was treated with antithrombotic therapy, and follow-up angiography showed normalization of the left ICA. Cervical ICA dissection due to trivial trauma usually appears as an eccentric tapered stenosis arising at the origin of the ICA and resolves with complete or excellent recovery in most cases. Surgical or endovascular treatment should be reserved for patients who have persistent symptoms of ischemia despite adequate antithrombotic treatment.

AB OBJECTIVES: We investigated arterial blood gas abnormalities in patients presenting with dizziness. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 58 patients (39 females, 19 males; mean age 46 years; range 22 to 74 years) who presented during attacks of dizziness. The duration of vertigo complaints ranged from one day to 30 years. Arterial gas measurements were performed at presentation and one month after treatment. The patients were examined in five groups according to the diagnoses: Meniere's disease (n=14), benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (n=13), vertebrobasilar insufficiency (n=12), vestibular neuritis (n=4), and craniocervical myofascial syndromes (n=15). RESULTS: At presentation, pH was low (acidosis) in two patients (3.5%), and high (alkalosis) in 15 patients (25.9%). After treatment, all abnormal pH values returned to normal. Twenty-four patients had high or low HCO3- values. High HCO3- values persisted in three patients together with dizziness. Patients with vestibular neuritis had significantly higher PO2 values compared to those with craniocervical myofascial syndrome and vertebrobasilar insufficiency (p<0.05). However, one month after treatment, there were no significant differences between five groups with respect to PO2 levels (p>0.05). Consecutive blood gas measurements did not differ significantly within each diagnosis group (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that arterial blood gas abnormalities may be related to vertigo attacks.

AB A 37-year-old man consulted after two episodes of transient anomia for people's names over a period of 6 months. The first episode lasted about 10 min and was restricted to an inability to remember his 2-year-old son's first name. The second, was limited to an inability to recall his daughter's first name for 5 min with clear abnormal experiential quality. Witnessed descriptions of the attacks confirmed the absence of any other cognitive impairment or motor automatisms. The neurological examination was normal except for hyposmia. Inter-ictal cognitive evaluation was normal apart from the anomia for people's names or retrieval of names of familiar people in his childhood on definition and on famous faces naming test. A wake electroencephalograph showed left temporal epileptiform abnormalities, following hyperpnea. On magnetic resonance imaging, quantitative analysis revealed a mildly decreased volume of the left hippocampus. The diagnosis of transient epileptic amnesia (TEA) was considered and the patient did not recur for 6 months under lamotriginum. Thus anomia for people's names may be the sole clinical manifestation of TEA. Such a clinical presentation may easily be overlooked. Treatment may prevent further recurrence and the installation of more important and permanent autobiographical memory impairment. Our observation may suggest an isolated system not only for people's knowledge, but for people's naming. It is consistent with the notion of proper name as pure referring expression.

AB Face recognition is an increasingly popular method for user authentication. However, face recognition is susceptible to playback attacks. Therefore, a reliable way to detect malicious attacks is crucial to the robustness of the system. We propose and validate a novel physics-based method to detect images recaptured from printed material using only a single image. Micro-textures present in printed paper manifest themselves in the specular component of the image. Features extracted from this component allows a linear SVM classifier to achieve 2.2% False Acceptance Rate and 13% False Rejection Rate (6.7% Equal Error Rate). We also show that the classifier can be generalizable to contrast enhanced recaptured images and LCD screen recaptured images without re-training, demonstrating the robustness of our approach. ©2010 IEEE.

AB The nation's security cannot be restored with more fences and gates. Trusted identity, which can be attained with biometrics, is a universal solution. Every person has unique non-intrusive, accurate, and permanent biometrics that cannot be stolen or forgotten. A person's facial characteristics are unique, but difficult and expensive to quantify in a quickly-accessible and rusted file that contains the comprehensive data on millions of faces. This paper presents various security technologies to protect a country from several terrorist attacks.

AB With the prevalence of the information age, privacy and personalization are forefront in today's society. As such, biometrics are viewed as essential components of current and evolving technological systems. Consumers demand unobtrusive and noninvasive approaches. In our previous work, we have demonstrated a speaker verification system that meets these criteria. However, there are additional constraints for fielded systems. The required recognition transactions are often performed in adverse environments and across diverse populations, necessitating robust solutions. There are two significant problem areas in current generation speaker verification systems. The first is the difficulty in acquiring clean audio signals (in all environments) without encumbering the user with a head-mounted close-talking microphone. Second, unimodal biometric systems do not work with a significant percentage of the population. To combat these issues, multimodal techniques are being investigated to improve system robustness to environmental conditions, as well as improve overall accuracy across the population. We propose a multimodal approach that builds on our current state-of-the-art speaker verification technology. In order to maintain the transparent nature of the speech interface, we focus on optical sensing technology to provide the additional modality-giving us an audio-visual person recognition system. For the audio domain, we use our existing speaker verification system. For the visual domain, we focus on lip motion. This is chosen, rather than static face or iris recognition, because it provides dynamic information about the individual. In addition, the lip dynamics can aid speech recognition to provide liveness testing. The visual processing method makes use of both color and edge information, combined within a Markov random field (MRF) framework, to localize the lips. Geometric features are extracted and input to a polynomial classifier for the person recognition process. A late integration approach, based on a probabilistic model, is employed to combine the two modalities. The system is tested on the XM2VTS database combined with AWGN (in the audio domain) over a range of signal-to-noise ratios.

AB Face recognition as an identity authentication has been widely used in commodity mobile systems. However due to increasing attacks against face recognition algorithms, mobile systems users begin to concern about the security of face recognition modules in their mobile devices. In this paper, we focus on synthetic and adversarial face image attack on both Baidu and Face++ face comparison APIs. To make a fair comparison, we also tested on Google facenet as the baseline. The results show Both APIs are vulnerable to synthetic and adversarial attacks. Although liveness detection mechanisms could mitigate the synthetic attack in our experiment, not all APIs have this feature. The API without liveness detection mechanism(Face++) is vulnerable to presentation attack. The accept rate in Baidu API could be affected by security level of liveness detection control. Both dodging and impersonation adversarial image attacks are correlated to the perturbation level, the higher perturbation level the more likely to be successful in dodging attack, in the contrast,the lower perturbation level is more likely to lead a successful impersonation attack. In our experiment, Baidu Liveness detection mechanism can detect adversarial images as synthetic images and reject a majority of adversarial image attacks. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB Face verification systems are prone to spoofing attacks on photos, videos, and 3D masks. Face spoofing detection, i.e., face anti-spoofing, face liveness detection, or face presentation attack detection, is an important task for securing face verification systems in practice and presents many challenges. In this paper, a state-of-the-art face spoofing detection method based on a depth-based Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) is revisited. Different supervision schemes, including global and local label supervisions, are comprehensively investigated. A generic theoretical analysis and associated simulation are provided to demonstrate that local label supervision is more suitable than global label supervision for local tasks with insufficient training samples, such as the face spoofing detection task. Based on the analysis, the Spatial Aggregation of Pixel-level Local Classifiers (SAPLC), which is composed of an FCN part and an aggregation part, is proposed. The FCN part predicts the pixel-level ternary labels, which include the genuine foreground, the spoofed foreground, and the undetermined background. Then, these labels are aggregated together to yield an accurate image-level decision. Furthermore, to quantitatively evaluate the proposed SAPLC, experiments are carried out on the CASIA-FASD, Replay-Attack, OULU-NPU, and SiW datasets. The experiments show that the proposed SAPLC outperforms the representative deep networks, including two globally supervised CNNs, one depth-based FCN, two FCNs with binary labels, and two FCNs with ternary labels, and achieves competitive performances close to some state-of-the-art method performances under various common protocols. Overall, the results empirically verify the advantage of the proposed pixel-level local label supervision scheme. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) describes a network infrastructure of identifiable things that share data through the Internet. A smart home is one of the applications for the Internet of Things. In a smart home, household appliances could be monitored and controlled remotely. This raises a demand for reliable security solutions for IoT systems. Authorization and authentication are challenging IoT security operations that need to be considered. For instance, unauthorized access, such as cyber-attacks, to a smart home system could cause danger by controlling sensors and actuators, opening the doors for a thief. This paper applies an extra layer of security of multi-factor authentication to act as a prevention method for mitigating unauthorized access. One of those factors is face recognition, as it has recently become popular due to its non-invasive biometric techniques, which is easy to use with cameras attached to most trending computers and smartphones. In this paper, the gaps in existing IoT smart home systems have been analyzed, and we have suggested improvements for overcoming them by including necessary system modules and enhancing user registration and log-in authentication. We propose software architecture for implementing such a system. To the best of our knowledge, the existing IoT smart home management research does not support face recognition and liveness detection within the authentication operation of their suggested software architectures. © Science and Information Organization.

AB Multimodal biometric systems offer numerous advantages over unimodal counterparts and are being used extensively in diverse applications. However, fusion of biometric data is a non-trivial task and curtail employability of multimodal systems for a varying set of biometric characteristics with different type and dimension. Moreover, comprehensive solutions against adversary attacks that ensure template protection and prevent presentation attacks are not in place. In this article, a secure multimodal cancelable biometric system is proposed to address these concerns. This approach introduces key images based generic feature extraction technique which reduces feature dimension and achieves revocability. The non-invertibility and unlinkability are ensured through cross-diffusion of complementary information from different modalities. A new feature fusion method based on an adaptive graph is proposed to generate multimodal cancelable biometric templates. Robustness against presentation attack is accomplished through quality based adaptation of features. Extensive experimentation is performed on benchmark databases for fingerprint, face, and iris, to illustrate the efficacy of multimodal cancelable templates. The proposed approach is shown to perform favorably against state-of-the-art feature fusion methods. Furthermore, the resilience of the proposed approach against security and privacy attacks is demonstrated. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB To counter face presentation attacks in face recognition (FR), color texture has been successfully used for face presentation attack detection (PAD) in recent years. However, the existing research does not fully consider the correlation between different color channels as well as the optimization of classification for face PAD. To resolve these limitations, a face PAD scheme based on chromatic co-occurrence of local binary pattern (CCoLBP) and ensemble learning (EL) is proposed in this paper. A color distortion-based face PAD model is first built, and then the chromatic discrepancies between bona fide faces and artefacts are analyzed. After that, CCoLBP is extracted as the feature to characterize these discrepancies. Meanwhile, an EL based classifier is put forward to reduce the effect of class imbalance and to improve the generalization ability. Experimental results and analysis indicate that the proposed scheme can achieve an overall good performance. Moreover, it can achieve significant improvement in the cross-database test, and its computational complexity can meet the requirement of real time applications. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB Face anti-spoofing in unconstrained environment is one of the key issues in face biometric based authentication and security applications. To minimize the false alarms in face anti-spoofing tests, this paper proposes a novel approach to learn perturbed feature maps by perturbing the convolutional feature maps with Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features. The perturbed feature maps are learned simultaneously during training of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for face anti-spoofing, in an end-to-end fashion. Extensive experiments are performed on state-of-the-art face anti-spoofing databases, like OULU-NPU, CASIA-FASD and Replay-Attack, in both intra-database and cross-database scenarios. Experimental results indicate that the proposed framework perform significantly better compare to previous state-of-the-art approaches in both intra-database and cross-database face anti-spoofing scenarios. &#x00A9; 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

DE Context information; Deep learning; Face liveness detection; Texture information;
AB Face liveness detection, as a key module of real face recognition systems, is to distinguish a fake face from a real one. In this paper, we propose an improved Convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with two bypass connections to simultaneously utilize low-level detailed information and high-level semantic information. Considering the importance of the texture information for describing face images, texture features are also adopted under the conventional recognition framework of Support vector machine (SVM). The improved CNN and the texture feature based SVM are fused. Context information which is usually neglected by existing methods is well utilized in this paper. Two widely used datasets are used to test the proposed method. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. © 2019 Chinese Institute of Electronics.

AB Background: It is unknown whether clinical parameters differ between migraineurs with and without first-degree family members with migraine. Objectives: The present cross-sectional study describes differences between familial and sporadic migraine with a focus on migraine characteristics, migraine severity, comorbidities, and treatment. Method: From the Danish Headache Center we recruited 358 patients with familial migraine and 1727 patients with sporadic migraine. Each participant was assessed using a validated semi-structured interview. Results: No differences in age (Mean = 44 and 44 [SD = 12.28 and 12.58] for familial and sporadic migraineurs, respectively; P =.900) or sex (295/358 (82.4%) and 1413/1727 (81.8%) women in familial and sporadic migraineurs, respectively; P =.853) were found. Familial migraineurs had more aphasic aura than sporadic migraineurs (41% vs 27%, P =.001). Sporadic migraineurs had more lifetime attacks ie, >100 attacks (45% vs 70%, P <.001) and prolonged attacks ie, lasting >72 hours (5% vs 12%, P <.001) than familial migraineurs. Further, sporadic migraineurs had a higher incidence of concussions (37% vs 41%, P =.001) compared to familial migraineurs. In agreement with a previous study, there was no difference between familial and sporadic migraine regarding triptan response (84% vs 81%, P =.440). Conclusion: Headache characteristics, triptan response, and comorbidities where similar in individulas with and without inherited migraine, suggesting that migraine are to be considered a hmogenoues disease. The difference in the clinical presentation of migraine with aura symptoms among patients with familial migraine should be considered in future studies. Further, more severe migraine among patients with sporadic migraine with aura could suggest that sporadic migraineurs have been exposed to stronger or multiple environmental factors and indicate that an early intervention in migraine treatment could lessen the severity of migraine. © 2019 The Authors.

AB We present a real-time liveness detection approach against photograph spoofing in face recognition, by recognizing spontaneous eyeblinks, which is a non-intrusive manner. The approach requires no extra hardware except for a generic webcamera. Eyeblink sequences often have a complex underlying structure. We formulate blink detection as inference in an undirected conditional graphical framework, and are able to learn a compact and efficient observation and transition potentials from data. For purpose of quick and accurate recognition of the blink behavior, eye closity, an easily-computed discriminative measure derived from the adaptive boosting algorithm, is developed, and then smoothly embedded into the conditional model. An extensive set of experiments are presented to show effectiveness of our approach and how it outperforms the cascaded Adaboost and HMM in task of eyeblink detection. ©2007 IEEE.

AB The face image is the most accessible biometric modality which is used for highly accurate face recognition systems, while it is vulnerable to many different types of presentation attacks. Face anti-spoofing is a very critical step before feeding the face image to biometric systems. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stream CNN-based approach for face anti-spoofing, by extracting the local features and holistic depth maps from the face images. The local features facilitate CNN to discriminate the spoof patches independent of the spatial face areas. On the other hand, holistic depth map examine whether the input image has a face-like depth. Extensive experiments are conducted on the challenging databases (CASIA-FASD, MSU-USSA, and Replay Attack), with comparison to the state of the art. © 2017 IEEE.

AB In this study, an advanced Kinect sensor was adopted to acquire infrared radiation (IR) images for liveness detection. The proposed liveness detection method based on infrared radiation (IR) images can deal with face spoofs. Face pictures were acquired by a Kinect camera and converted into IR images. Feature extraction and classification were carried out by a deep neural network to distinguish between real individuals and face spoofs. IR images collected by the Kinect camera have depth information. Therefore, the IR pixels from live images have an evident hierarchical structure, while those from photos or videos have no evident hierarchical feature. Accordingly, two types of IR images were learned through the deep network to realize the identification of whether images were from live individuals. In comparison with other liveness detection cross-databases, our recognition accuracy was 99.8% and better than other algorithms. FaceNet is a face recognition model, and it is robust to occlusion, blur, illumination, and steering. We combined the liveness detection and FaceNet model for identity authentication. For improving the application of the authentication approach, we proposed two improved ways to run the FaceNet model. Experimental results showed that the combination of the proposed liveness detection and improved face recognition had a good recognition effect and can be used for identity authentication. © 2019 by the authors.

AB Automatically recognising people by their biometric characteristics is a well-established research area. Biometric systems are vulnerable to many different types of presentation attacks made by persons showing photo, video, or mask to spoof the real identity. This study introduces a novel approach to detect face-spoofing, by extracting the local features local binary pattern (LBP) and simplified weber local descriptor (SWLD) encoded convolutional neural network (CNN) models, WLD and LBP features are combined together to ensure the preservation of the local intensity information and the orientations of the edges. These two components are complementary to each other. Specifically, differential excitation preserves the local intensity information but omits the orientations of edges. On the contrary, LBP describes the orientations of the edges but ignore the intensity information, the proposed approach presents a very low degree of complexity which makes it suitable for real-time applications, Finally, a non-linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier with kernel function was used for determining whether the input image corresponds to a live face or not. Authors' experimental analysis on two publicly available databases REPLAYATTACK and CASIA face anti-spoofing showed that their approach performs better than state-of-the-art techniques following the provided evaluation protocols of each database. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2019.

AB Face recognition and verification systems are vulnerable to video spoofing attacks. In this paper, we present a diffusion-based kernel matrix model for face liveness detection. We use the anisotropic diffusion to enhance the edges of each frame in a video, and the kernel matrix model to extract the video features which we call the diffusion kernel (DK) features. The DK features reflect the inner correlation of the face images in the video. We employ a generalized multiple kernel learning method to fuse the DK features and the deep features extracted from convolution neural networks to achieve better performance. Our experimental evaluation on two publicly available datasets shows that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-art face liveness detection methods. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB With the improvement of people's safety awareness and the renewal of smart home technology, access control security has become a special concern of community, schools and enterprises. How to achieve efficient, convenient, safe and intelligent access control management is the main research direction in the field of smart home right now.Based on multi-task cascade convolutional neural network (MTCNN) and improved face recognition algorithm k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), this paper proposes an interactive face liveness detection method by eye and mouth state.According to this method, an intelligent access control system based on machine vision is designed.The system solves the problem of identity forgery attacks by calling the camera to track the face in real time and issuing randomized action instructions to the user,after confirming that the object being detected is a living body and the face information matching is successful, the door lock will be opened.The experiment shows that the face recognition rate of the system can reach 98.3%, which has good practical significance. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB With the continued evolution of three dimensional (3D) object presentation and usage, the security of such objects has become an increasingly desirable research area. Previous efforts mostly concentrated on the encryption of point clouds, solid models, meshes, and 3D textured models. The (texture map) part of meshed 3D objects was overlooked by previous encryption techniques of 3D meshed objects in spite of its importance because they require preprocessing to be extracted. Therefore, this paper provides a system for the full encryption of 3D textured objects with their texture maps. It provides an improved system based on an existing flexible cryptosystem named Flexible cryptosystem based on Cellular Automata (FcCA). The FcCA system has two drawbacks. One drawback is shuffling plain data without changing their values, which yields the same histogram and nonstandard encryption ratios. The other drawback is the need for many generations to make the keyspace very large, which is unsuitable for the large size of textured object data. This work overcomes these drawbacks of FcCA and fully encrypts 3D textured objects with their texture maps. The improvements to FcCA include making intersect start points change with every generation and encrypting the values of plain data while shuffling them using cellular automata. At first, the plain 3D object is extracted to vertices, faces, and texture, in addition to its texture map. After that, extracted data are encrypted using the proposed improved FcCA (iFcCA) cryptosystem. Implementation and analysis of this new system showed its preponderance as it can encrypt and decrypt 3D textured objects better than FcCA and other existing methods. Moreover, it reduces the need for many generations of cellular automata, and consequently, reduces execution time. In addition, iFcCA has a very robust key, and it can resist different types of attacks. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB Face morphing attack images are built to be verifiable to multiple identities. Associating such images to identity documents leads to building faulty identity links, causing vulnerabilities in security critical processes. Recent works have studied the face morphing attack detection performance over variations in morphing approaches, pointing out low generalization. This work introduces a multi-detector fusion solution that aims at gaining both, accuracy and generalization over different morphing types. This is performed by fusing classification scores produced by detectors trained on databases with variations in morphing type and image pairing protocols. This work develop and evaluate the proposed solution along with baseline solutions by building a database with three different pairing protocols and two different morphing approaches. This proposed solution successfully lead to decreasing the Bona Fide Presentation Classification Error Rate at 1.0% Attack Presentation Classification Error Rate from 15.7% and 3.0% of the best performing single detector to 2.7% and 0.0%, respectively on two face morphing techniques, pointing out a highly generalized performance. © 2019 ISIF-International Society of Information Fusion.

AB The term “plenoptic” comes from the Latin words plenus (“full”) + optic. The plenoptic function is the 7-dimensional function representing the intensity of the light observed from every position and direction in 3-dimensional space. Thanks to the plenoptic function it is thus possible to define the direction of every ray in the light-field vector function. Imaging systems are rapidly evolving with the emergence of light-field-capturing devices. Consequently, existing image-processing techniques need to be revisited to match the richer information provided. This article explores the use of light fields for face analysis. This field of research is very recent but already includes several works reporting promising results. Such works deal with the main steps of face analysis and include but are not limited to: Face recognition; face presentation attack detection; facial soft-biometrics classification; and facial landmark detection. This article aims to review the state of the art on light fields for face analysis, identifying future challenges and possible applications. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB Face recognition (FR) is being widely used in many applications from access control to smartphone unlock. As a result, face presentation attack detection (PAD) has drawn increasing attentions to secure the FR systems. Traditional approaches for PAD mainly assume that training and testing scenarios are similar in imaging conditions (illumination, scene, camera sensor, etc.), and thus may lack good generalization capability into new application scenarios. In this work, we propose an end-to-end learning approach to improve PAD generalization capability by utilizing prior knowledge from source domain via adversarial domain adaptation. We first build a source domain PAD model optimized with triplet loss. Subsequently, we perform adversarial domain adaptation w.r.t. the target domain to learn a shared embedding space by both the source and target domain models, in which the discriminator cannot reliably predict whether a sample is from the source or target domain. Finally, PAD in the target domain is performed with k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier in the embedding space. The proposed approach shows promising generalization capability in a number of public-domain face PAD databases. © 2019 IEEE.

AB This paper presents a novel solution based on PPG to strengthen face authentication. Our method leverages and combines different PPG signals from multiple channels to meet two objectives. First, it complements face authentication with an additional authentication factor, and second, it strengthens the liveness detection to be more resistant against presentation attacks. Our solution can be implemented as an unlock screen for mobile phones having a front-side and back-side camera or a paired smart watch as well as for webcam-enabled laptops augmented with a PPG sensor. Our evaluation shows that our method can significantly improve the resilience against presentation attacks for face recognition-based user authentication. © 2019 IEEE.

AB This paper presents a face liveness detection system against spoofing with photographs, videos, and 3D models of a valid user in a face recognition system. Anti-spoofing clues inside and outside a face are both exploited in our system. The inside-face clues of spontaneous eyeblinks are employed for anti-spoofing of photographs and 3D models. The outside-face clues of scene context are used for anti-spoofing of video replays. The system does not need user collaborations, i.e. it runs in a non-intrusive manner. In our system, the eyeblink detection is formulated as an inference problem of an undirected conditional graphical framework which models contextual dependencies in blink image sequences. The scene context clue is found by comparing the difference of regions of interest between the reference scene image and the input one, which is based on the similarity computed by local binary pattern descriptors on a series of fiducial points extracted in scale space. Extensive experiments are carried out to show the effectiveness of our system. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB User authentication for an accurate biometric system is the demand of the hour in today's world. When somebody attempts to take on the appearance of another person by introducing a phony face or video before the face detection camera and gets illegitimate access, a face presentation attack usually happens. To effectively protect the privacy of a person, it is very critical to build a face authentication and anti-spoofing system. This paper introduces a novel and appealing face spoof detection technique, which is primarily based on the study of contrast and dynamic texture features of both seized and spoofed photos. Valid identification of photo spoofing is anticipated here. A modified version of the DoG filtering method, and local binary pattern variance (LBPV) based technique, which is invariant to rotation, are designated to be used in this paper. Support vector machine (SVM) is used when feature vectors are extracted for further analysis. The publicly available NUAA photo-imposter database is adapted to test the system, which includes facial images with different illumination and area. The accuracy of the method can be assessed using the false acceptance rate (FAR) and false rejection rate (FRR). The results express that our method performs better on key indices compared to other state-of-the-art techniques following the provided evaluation protocols tested on a similar dataset. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB The vulnerability of face recognition systems towards evolving presentation attacks has drawn significant interest in the last decade. In this paper, we present an empirical study on both vulnerability analysis and presentation attack detection for commercial face recognition systems (FRS) using custom 3D silicone face masks corresponding to real subjects. To this end, a new database is collected consisting of 8 custom 3D silicone masks together with bona fide presentations of the corresponding subjects using three different devices (smartphones). The vulnerability of FRS for 3D face silicone face masks is effectively evaluated using two well-known commercial-off-The-shelf (COTS) FRS (Verilook from Neurotechnology, and the Cognitec Face-VACS). Further, extensive experiments are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of five state-of-The-Art presentation attack detection (PAD) techniques for detecting such masks. Key insights on silicone mask PAD are provided along with a discussion on the accuracy achieved in our experiments. © 2019 IEEE.

AB Trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TAC) are primary headache disorders that are characterized by severe unilateral pain along the distribution of the trigeminal nerve with corresponding activation of the autonomic nervous system. The clinical characteristics and presentation of TAC are unique; however, there may be an overlap of these features with other painful conditions affecting the orofacial region, which can be a diagnostic challenge for the clinician. This article reports a case history and discusses the differences between clinical characteristics of TAC and other painful orofacial conditions. Refractory pain conditions and the occurrence of episodic pain attacks with accompanying autonomic symptoms necessitate a thorough evaluation to rule out rare causes of head and face pain. © 2019, Quintessenz.

AB The ability to offer remote access to services or data through various platforms has become a public expectation of many applications and systems nowadays. Recently, we can see the growth in trend where wide range of service providers offer the option to use biometric as a form of authentication, replacing conventional password system. While we gradually migrate towards such authentication method, it is important not to overlook the vulnerabilities of such systems to spoof attack. In fact, spoof attack must be prevented as a mandatory prerequisite in all biometric systems. In this paper, we present a systematic approach for face authentication that incorporates state-of-the-art liveness detection and face verification algorithms to safeguard a system against such attack. We explore and examine the feasibility of the application of such approach on generic devices and systems without incurring hardware dependencies or requiring extensive user-cooperation. © 2018 IEEE.

AB Face has been used as a popular biometric trait to identify a person. However, attacking such face recognition system is not challenging today by using for example a fake face photo or video in front of a camera. In this paper, we present a novel feature, namely, SBP-TOP, to effectively identify such spoofings. SBP-TOP presents the texture information for the face region from both spatial and temporal perspectives. We have tested the proposed feature on two well-known face spoofing datasets: new Michigan State University mobile face spoofing database (MSU MFSD) and CASIA Face Anti-Spoofing Database (CASIA). The results indicate an accuracy over 95% on both datasets and there is an improvement over the state-of-the-art feature by around 10% and 3.2%, respectively. © 2018 IEEE.

AB Despite a great deal of progress in face Recognition technologies, current solutions are still vulnerable to spoof attacks. In fact, it is easy to access digital replicas of facial biometric information from readily available photos, videos and 3D masks. The literature contains several face anti spoofing methods that try to detect whether the face in the front of the Recognition system is real or an artificial replica. However, these methods are not robust and require many improvements since they are sensitive to lightening conditions and pose variations. In order to address these issues, we propose a novel face anti spoofing method based on Multi Color Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture named DeepColorFASD. Our approach investigates the effect of space colors (RGB, HSV and Y CbCr) on CNN architectures and proposes a fusion based voting method for face anti spoofing. In addition, we also explain the resulting feature maps visualizations. We evaluate our system through an experimental study using CASIA FASD: a well-known face anti spoofing database. The results using this challenging database demonstrate that our solution performs better than recent works as measured by Half Total Error Rate (HTER) and ROC curve. © 2018 IEEE.

AB Audiovisual speech synchrony detection is an important part of talking-face verification systems. Prior work has primarily focused on visual features and joint-space models, while standard mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) have been commonly used to present speech. We focus more closely on audio by studying the impact of context window length for delta feature computation and comparing MFCCs with simpler energy-based features in lip-sync detection. We select state-of-the-art hand-crafted lip-sync visual features, space-time auto-correlation of gradients (STACOG), and canonical correlation analysis (CCA), for joint-space modeling. To enhance joint space modeling, we adopt deep CCA (DCCA), a nonlinear extension of CCA. Our results on the XM2VTS data indicate substantially enhanced audiovisual speech synchrony detection, with an equal error rate (EER) of 3.68%. Further analysis reveals that failed lip region localization and beardedness of the subjects constitutes most of the errors. Thus, the lip motion description is the bottleneck, while the use of novel audio features or joint-modeling techniques is unlikely to boost lip-sync detection accuracy further. © 2018 IEEE.

AB Conventional face anti-spoofing paradigms tend to operate on plain facial profiles and learn either the natural face space alone (one-class training problem) or both the natural face space as well as the spoof sample space (2-class training problem). However, this rigidity with respect to spatially constrained measurements, makes the base feature or statistic vulnerable to noise related to pose and camera perspective/orientational and scale changes. Noting that the sharpness profile computed on a natural face is largely independent of the pose and perspective change, it is imperative that the measurements be extracted in an identity independent setting by ignoring the pose/perspective variation. To facilitate this, we have deployed a 2-dimensional random walk for capturing lower order pixel correlation statistics from natural faces, with virtually no perceptual interference. The proposed identity independent frame has surpassed the state of the art with reference to a 3D mask dataset (image oriented, isolated frame setting), with an EER of $$2.25\%$$ without auto-population and an EER of $$0.45\%$$ with auto-population. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB Biometric-based human authentication can provide acceptable level of security to mobile devices such as a tablets and smartphones. Face is one of the most popular choices for biometrics on mobile device since the user can conveniently capture his face image by taking a selfie. Like any other security system, selfie face recognition is also vulnerable to attacks wherein an imposter can present photograph of a genuine user to gain an access to the mobile device. Liveness detection is an essential counter-measure to spoof attacks. In adverse scenarios, an attacker can physically force the user to provide his facial image to unlock the phone. In such cases, facial expression detection can act as a counter-measure. This chapter investigates face-based human recognition techniques on mobile devices and highlight methods having liveness and threat awareness. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB Face recognition systems (FRS) have been found to be highly vulnerable to face morphing attacks. Due to this severe security risk, morph detection systems do not only need to be robust against classical landmark-based face morphing approach (LMA), but also future attacks such as neural network based morph generation techniques. The focus of this paper lies on an experimental evaluation of the morph detection capabilities of various state-of-the-art morph detectors with respect to a recently presented novel face morphing approach, MorGAN, which is based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). In this work, existing detection algorithms are confronted with different attack scenarios: known and unknown attacks comprising different morph types (LMA and MorGAN). The detectors’ performance results are highly dependent on the features used by the detection algorithms. In addition, the image quality of the morphed face images produced with the MorGAN approach is assessed using well-established no-reference image quality metrics and compared to LMA morphs. The results indicate that the image quality of MorGAN morphs is more similar to bona fide images compared to classical LMA morphs. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB Objective: To present a number of cases with elongated styloid process (Eagle) syndrome and to discuss the clinical presentation of this disorder. Methods: A clinical study of patients operated on at King Abdul-Aziz University Hospital, Riyadh, from 1992 to 1996. Results: The study group consisted of seven patients (six females and one male ranging in age from 20 to 43 years). Symptomatically, two distinct groups of patients could be identified: the classic syndrome (including three patients), which occurs in the tonsillectomized patients, and the styloid-carotid artery syndrome (including four patients), which occurs independently of tonsillectomy. In the first type, patients usually complain of spastic and nagging pain in the pharynx radiating to the mastoid region. In the second group, patients usually complain of attacks of syncope in association with pharyngeal pain referred to the course of the carotid artery. Diagnosis is made by history taking, palpating the tonsillar fossa, and radiographic demonstration of the process. Three-dimensional computed tomography reconstruction images were found to be very reliable in measuring the actual length of the styloid process and the stylohyoid ligament. Conclusion: This unusual disorder should be considered in the differential diagnosis of facial pain in some patients and as the cause of syncope in other patients. The paper discusses the embryologic, anatomic, pathogenetic, clinical, and therapeutic aspects of elongated styloid process with calcified stylohyoid ligament and the differential diagnosis is detailed.

AB Compared to 2D face presentation attacks (e.g. printed photos and video replays), 3D type attacks are more challenging to face recognition systems (FRS) by presenting 3D characteristics or materials similar to real faces. Existing 3D face spoofing databases, however, mostly based on 3D masks, are restricted to small data size or poor authenticity due to the production difficulty and high cost. In this work, we introduce the first wax figure face database, WFFD, as one type of super-realistic 3D presentation attacks to spoof the FRS. This database consists of 2200 images with both real and wax figure faces (totally 4400 faces) with a high diversity from online collections. Experiments on this database first investigate the vulnerability of three popular FRS to this kind of new attack. Further, we evaluate the performance of several face presentation attack detection methods to show the attack abilities of this super-realistic face spoofing database. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB This paper investigates how a stigmatised company mobilised accounting, particularly CSR reporting, to manage a crisis of legitimacy and spoiled identity following a series of social and environmental crises. Specifically, it uses Goffman's (1959, 1963) writings on stigma and presentation of self and Benoit's (1995) image restoration theory to explore how a large mining company in Tanzania used various strategic responses in striving to distance and dissociate itself from the attached ‘stigma’. The evidence shows that, in response to attacks from pressure-group organisations, rather than apologising for the social and environmental crises, the company was preocupied with ‘defensive stigma management’ strategies, including denial and refocusing attention, evading responsibility, image bolstering, excuses and dissociation. Drawing on our findings, we argue that, rather than making the effects of stigma more visible, accounting and CSR disclosures were mobilised to conceal the threats of stigma, manage the legitimacy crisis and repair spoiled identity. This study moves beyond the current focus on legitimacy in the extant CSR reporting literature, by bringing in the concept of organisational stigma to examine stigma management strategies implemented by a company operating in a stigmatised industry to avoid, reduce or minimise its audiences’ disapproval. © 2019

AB Biometric authentication is becoming more prevalent for secured authentication systems. However, the biometric systems can be deceived by the imposters in several ways. Among other imposter attacks, print attacks, mask-attacks, and replay-attacks fall under the presentation attack category. The biometric images, especially iris and face, are vulnerable to different presentation attacks. This research applies deep learning approaches to mitigate the presentation attacks in a biometric access control system. Our contribution in this paper is two-fold: first, we applied the wavelet transform to extract the features from the biometric images. Second, we modified the deep residual neural net and applied it on the spoof datasets in an attempt to detect the presentation attacks. This research applied deep learning technique on three biometric spoof datasets: ATVS, CASIA two class, and CASIA cropped image sets. The datasets used in this research contain images that are captured both in a controlled and uncontrolled environment along with different resolution and sizes. We obtained the best accuracy of 93% on the ATVS Iris dataset. For CASIA two class and CASIA cropped datasets, we achieved test accuracies of 91% and 82%, respectively. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB With the advanced 3D reconstruction and printing technologies, creating a super-real 3D facial mask becomes feasible at an affordable cost. This brings a new challenge to face presentation attack detection (PAD) against 3D facial mask attack. As such, there is an urgent need to solve this problem as many face recognition systems have been deployed in real-world applications. Since this is a relatively new research problem, few studies has been conducted and reported. In order to attract more attentions on 3D mask face PAD, this book chapter summarizes the progress in the past few years, as well as publicly available datasets. Finally, some open problems in 3D mask attack are discussed. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB Introduction: Hereditary angioedema type 1 (HAE1) is a rare autosomal-dominant genetic disorder caused by a mutation of the SERPIN 1 gene on chromosome 11 (11q12.1) that codes for the synthesis of the enzyme C1 esterase inhibitor (C1INH). E Moran et al first reported HAE1 among members of a Zulu family in rural northern KwaZulu-Natal (the NM family) in 2008. We studied four consecutive generations of this family in order to: • determine the genetic burden; • identify the common clinical manifestations of HAE1 acute episodes; • review the therapeutic challenges in this rural setting in comparison to world standards, and • evaluate the socio-economic burden inflicted by the disease. Methods: Twenty-nine NM family members with possible HAE1 were collectively identified by the family, and those unable to attend at least one of the three booked Medical Outpatients Department appointments were excluded, which resulted in a final study sample of 13. An interview was conducted and a family tree was drawn identifying the affected individuals in four consecutive generations. Information concerning acute clinical presentations in the past year (2017) was documented. A questionnaire was used to obtain the relevant HAE1-associated socio-economic burdens. A chart review was done to identify the prophylactic and acute therapeutic strategies used by doctors in this region. Blood samples for C1INH levels, complement C3 and C4, were taken to make a diagnosis of HAE1, and C-Reactive protein (CRP) was taken to rule out an acute episode. Results: Polygamy as a local practice was found to be an important factor that perpetuated the genetic burden of the disease. When compared to the laboratories’ normal value indices, C1INH levels were significantly lower than that of the population mean (30 mg/dL), with a mean of 5.45 mg/dL (CI: 3.97–6.92, SD–1.65, p<0.01) and a variance of 2.71. C4 levels were also significantly lower than that of the population mean (0.25 g/L), with a mean of 0.03 g/L (CI: 0.0087–0.0513, SD–0.0252, p<0.01) and a variance of 0.0006. The findings were suggestive of HAE1 in all the participants individually. Clinical features during acute attacks included angioedema of the extremities (100%), face (69%), neck (23%) and larynx (8%). Therapeutic strategies for acute attacks included fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or fresh dried plasma (FDP) depending upon the availability of FFP. Danazol was the prophylactic drug of choice despite its potentially deleterious side-effects, including virilisation, which occurred in one of the female participants. These treatment strategies were due to the unavailability of newer agents in this region. HAE1 has had a significan

AB While it has been shown that using 3D information might significantly benefit face anti-spoofing systems, traditional color images are still generally used, due to several issues such as expensive hardware requirement, high time cost, or poor accessibility when obtaining and using true 3D images. Thus, we could use RGB-D images captured by relatively low cost sensors instead, e.g., Kinect cameras, to achieve better performance without consuming huge amount of time or money. This research presents a novel multimodal face anti-spoofing method, which makes full use of available information on RGB-D images and no manually chosen regions are needed. For every pair of RGB-D images, first of all, we calculate the correlation between color and depth images to detect multimodal properties; then, by analyzing the consistency of sub regions extracted from the depth image, we are able to distinguish flat spoofing faces from genuine human beings. Both anti-spoofing features are fused to make final anti-spoofing decisions. Experiments on both self-collected and pubic 3DMAD datasets show that our proposed approach is effective for intra-dataset and cross-dataset testing scenarios, and that our method could deal with different presentation attacks carried by photos, tablet screens, and face masks. © 2018 IEEE.

AB The effectiveness of the state-of-the-art face verifi-cation/recognition algorithms and the convenience of face recognition greatly boost the face-related biometric authentication applications. However, existing face verification architectures seldom integrate any liveness detection or keep such stage isolated from face verification as if it was irrelevant. This may potentially result in the system being exposed to spoof attacks between the two stages. This work introduces FaceLiveNet, a holistic end-to-end deep networks which can perform face verification and liveness detection simultaneously. An interactive scheme for facial expression recognition is proposed to perform liveness detection, providing better generalization capacity and higher security level. The proposed framework is low-cost as it relies on commodity hardware instead of costly sensors, and lightweight with much fewer parameters comparing to the other popular deep networks such as VGG16 and FaceNet. Experimental results on the benchmarks LFW, YTF, CK+, OuluCASIA, SFEW, FER2013 demonstrate that the proposed FaceLiveNet can achieve state-of-art performance or better for both face verification and facial expression recognition. We also introduce a new protocol to evaluate the global performance for face authentication with the fusion of face verification and interactive facial expression-based liveness detection. © 2018 IEEE.

AB Biometrics is a measure of unique and permanent physical or behavioral traits of an individual. As they are unique, they are more reliable in verifying a claimed identity. The Biometric Authentication System is an emerging domain that provides an efficient solution in improving digital security. Biometric authentication is the identification and verification process to determine the identity of a user by measuring characteristics like voice, iris, face, fingerprint samples. Even though Biometric Authentication Systems are better than traditional PIN/Password based authentication systems in most aspects, they are vulnerable to attacks. This paper is an overview of such security concerns of Biometric Authentication Systems, and their possible solutions. © 2018 IEEE.

AB In face verification applications, precision rate and identifying liveness are two key factors. Traditional methods usually recognize global faces and can not gain good enough results when the faces are captured from different ages, or there are some interference factors, such as facial shade, etc. Besides, the false face attack will pose a great security risk. To solve the above problems, this study examines how to achieve reliable living face verification based on Multi-CNNs (convolutional neural networks) and Bayes probability. Participants are required to make several expressions in random orders and contents, to ensure their liveness. Then, an effective component-based method is proposed for face recognition, and synthesized multiple CNNs can help reflecting intensities of different components. Eventually, the similarity between faces is calculated by integrating the results of each CNN, with the help of Bayes probability. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms traditional methods in face recognition accuracy. Moreover, our algorithm has unique preponderance in that it can verify the liveness of users, which can achieve higher security. © 2019 The Authors.

AB Background: Hereditary angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency (C1-INH-HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant disease characterized by episodes of acute subcutaneous swelling, and/or recurrent severe abdominal pain. The disease is potentially fatal if the upper-airway is involved. Iatrogenic harm can occur if HAE is not considered in the differential diagnosis, the specialists are not aware of the natural history, diagnosis and treatment of HAE, or as a result of unnecessary surgical and other iatrogenic interventions. Case presentation: We present the case of a 72-year-old man who began suffering recurrent abdominal pain at the age of 8 years. The pain led to frequent emergency department visits, three emergency surgical interventions, and 5 endoscopies before C1-INH-HAE was diagnosed at the age of 70. Infrequent subcutaneous swellings were attributed to unknown allergic reactions that were not related to the primary diagnosis of abdominal pain. Family history was positive for recurrent abdominal pain and angioedema but was ignored until the propositus' grandson developed recurrent severe oro-facial edema attacks. The boy's mother searched the worldwide web and found educational materials on a patient association website. She suggested complement C4 and C1-INH testing that led to the appropriate diagnosis of C1-INH-HAE type 1 in her son and his grandfather. Conclusion: This report emphasizes the importance of accurately evaluating personal and family history in patients with a long history of recurrent, acute, severe but medically unexplained abdominal pain and cutaneous swellings. Here, the diagnosis of HAE was overlooked for 62 years and the focus on abdominal complaints led to numerous surgical interventions without consideration of the full differential diagnosis. Screening family members from all generations for unrecognized angioedema, abdominal pain, and measurement of C1-INH and C4 are essential for accurate and timely diagnosis of HAE. © 2018 The Author(s).

TI Learning Deep Models for Face Anti-Spoofing: Binary or Auxiliary Super

AB Face anti-spoofing is crucial to prevent face recognition systems from a security breach. Previous deep learning approaches formulate face anti-spoofing as a binary classification problem. Many of them struggle to grasp adequate spoofing cues and generalize poorly. In this paper, we argue the importance of auxiliary supervision to guide the learning toward discriminative and generalizable cues. A CNN-RNN model is learned to estimate the face depth with pixel-wise supervision, and to estimate rPPG signals with sequence-wise supervision. The estimated depth and rPPG are fused to distinguish live vs. spoof faces. Further, we introduce a new face anti-spoofing database that covers a large range of illumination, subject, and pose variations. Experiments show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art results on both intra- and cross-database testing. © 2018 IEEE.

AB The recognition frameworks are highly vulnerable to spoofing attacks and this vulnerability generates an effective security concerned issues in biometric domain. Moreover, some of the earlier proposed approaches have attained attractive results with intra test (i.e. by training and testing the system on same database) evaluation done to detect the face spoofing attack. Consequently, most of these techniques generate incorrect decision on the recognition of genuine faces with unseen attacks in case of inter test evaluation (i.e. the system is trained on one database and then tested on another database). However, this impact is considered as a major difficulty in the highly focused biometric anti-spoofing research domain. In this work, we propose a multimodal biometric framework for the accurate recognition of fake face from genuine face. Initially, face image features which are coupled to the color spaces HSV and YCbCr are extracted with EDGHM-SURF (Enhanced Discrete Gaussian-Hermite Moment based Speed-up Robust Feature) descriptor. Then, a newly developed method of feature-level fusion using OGWO (FLFO) is used to fuse these extracted features. This method utilized the OGWO (Oppositional Gray Wolf Optimization) algorithm due to its excellent exploitation and exploration behavior in the identification of optimal weight score from the solution space, without allowing the solutions to stick in the local optimum. Finally, the fused features are fed into the Layered k-SVM (k-support vector machine) classifier for the recognition of fake face. The experimental results of our proposed approach are evaluated on three traditional benchmark face spoofing databases, namely the Replay-Attack, the CASIA Face Anti-Spoofing, and the MSU Mobile Face Spoof database. The outcome of our proposed approach exhibited steady and robust performance across all the three datasets. More commonly, our proposed approach executes well in the inter database tests and yields high performance, even though when only operated with minimized training data. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB Face recognition systems are widely known for their vulnerability against presentation attacks or spoofing attacks. The exponential deployment of face recognition systems has been further challenged even by the simple and low-cost face artefacts generated using conventional printers. In this paper, we present a novel scheme to detect face presentation attacks posed by high-quality print attacks which are relatively difficult to detect. The proposed scheme leverages the phase information extracted from the spatial-frequency representation of the given image. We also present a new face presentation attack database collected using the iPhone 6S. The new database is comprised of 100 subjects collected in two different sessions that have resulted in a total of 31228 samples (or images). Extensive experiments are carried out on the newly constructed database and the obtained results show the improved performance of the proposed scheme when compared aaainst six different state-of-the-art methods. © 2018 ISIF

AB Biometric Authentication Systems (BAS) have several security benefits over traditional password and token authentication including an inherent difficulty to copy, clone and share or distribute authentication credentials (biometric traits). Spoofing or presentation attack remains a major weakness of biometric systems and tackling it at the trait level is still challenging with several different approaches and methods applied in existing systems. In this paper, we focus on the well-known approach of Suspicious Presentation Detection (SPD) and present the Multi-Modal Random Trait Biometric Liveness Detection System (MMRTBLDS) that further mitigates spoofing or presentations attacks using randomization and combination of several different SPD detection techniques across three different modalities during trait capture. We discuss the detection of life using five distinct properties each from finger, face and eye modalities and present results from a simulation that highlights the improved security based on an impostor's inability to accurately predict the combination of trait liveness properties the system might prompt and test for during capture. © 2017 IEEE.

AB Biometrie person recognition systems based on facial images are increasingly used in a wide range of applications. However, the potential for face spoofing attacks remains a significant challenge to the security of such systems and finding better means of detecting such presentation attacks has become a necessity. In this paper, we propose a new spoofing detection method, which is based on temporal changes in texture information. A novel temporal texture descriptor is proposed to characterise the pattern of change in a short video sequence named Temporal Co-occurrence Adjacent Local Binary Pattern (TCoALBP). Experimental results using the CASIA-FA, Replay Attack and MSU-MFSD datasets; the proposed method shows the effectiveness of the proposed technique on these challenging datasets. © 2018 IEEE.

AB As security problem has become the tightest bottleneck in the application of face recognition systems, rendering a face recognition system robust against spoof attacks is of great significance to be dealt with. In this paper, aimed at video-based facial spoof attacks, an innovative face antispoofing algorithm based on local binary patterns (LBP) and multilayer discrete cosine transform (DCT) is proposed. First, we extract face images from a target video at a fixed time interval. Second, the low-level descriptors, i.e., the LBP features are generated for each extracted face image. After that, we perform multilayer DCT on the low-level descriptors to obtain the high-level descriptors (LBP-MDCT features). To be more exact, in each layer, the DCT operation is implemented along the ordinate axis of the obtained low-level descriptors, namely the time axis of the entire target video. In the last stage, the high-level descriptors are fed into a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to determine whether the target video is a spoof attack or a valid access. In contrast to existing approaches, the outstanding experimental results attained by the proposed approach on two widely-used datasets (Replay-Attack dataset and CASIA-FASD dataset) demonstrat its performance superiority as well as its low complexity and high efficiency. © 2018, Science Press.

AB Face liveness detection is widely used to detect face spoofing attacks. Most existing face liveness detection methods are mainly based on texture information of face images in the gray-scale space which ignored the chrominance information and other feature differences. In this paper, we introduced a novel modified color gradient feature into face liveness detection which used variant color roberts cross operator. This method can extract the color gradient information from the live faces or fake faces so that the proposed method has potential to achieve a better performance. Extensive experimental results on benchmark databases showed that the proposed variant color-gradient feature was very effective for face liveness detection. © 2017 IEEE.

AB Biometrics using biological or behavioral features to authenticate a person has attracted much attention as a new authentication approach against traditional ones such as key, password, etc. Biometrics technologies provide us better security and greater convenience than traditional person authentication technologies such as key, password and card. Biometric systems with cameras involve the risk of spoofing. For example in face recognition systems, when a malicious person turns a printed face photo of an authenticated user to a camera, a face recognition system may accept the malicious person as the authenticated user. To address the above problem, liveness detection is important to develop secure biometric recognition systems. This paper presents a liveness detection method using deep learning for face recognition systems. © 2017 IEEE.

AB Liveness detection is an important component in any facial biometrie system. It helps confirming that a real live person is in front of the camera. Given the ubiquity of the high-resolution printers and phone/tablet displays, popular attacks usually involve face prints or video replay. Most existing solutions rely on texture and local shape analysis to detect printing artifacts and light reflections in input attack images. In this paper, we propose extracting three low-level descriptors from the input face image, followed by polynomial classification and score level fusion. We show through our experiments how the fusion of multiple features and scores produced higher classification accuracy compared to the existing individual feature systems. We report our results on three popular benchmark datasets. © 2017 IEEE.

AB The unique features of human biometrics made it possible to benefit from these biometrics and use them as authentication methods. On the other hand, fraudulent biometrics are attempting to attack biometrics systems and are threatening the security of these systems. These risks can be avoided using liveness detection techniques, such as: heart rate measurement, pupil tracking, image quality assessment and many other techniques. Most face recognition systems use 2D cameras, where a 3D estimation of the face is derived as an antispoofing method. Not many systems are using 3D cameras for facial recognition, and therefore, its vulnerabilities to spoofing techniques are under-explored. In this paper, our purpose is to assess the 3D camera liveness assurance technique, and propose solutions that strengthens the gaps found in spoofing attack detection. Experiments will be conducted where we will use iFace 300 as a case study and attempt to attack the device using different attacking approaches such as mock face masks and 2D printed face images. We expect to discover weaknesses and strengths in the 3D liveness detection technique, and suggest methods to improve this technique. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB 3D mask face presentation attack, as a new challenge in face recognition, has been attracting increasing attention. Recently, remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) is employed as an intrinsic liveness cue which is independent of the mask appearance. Although existing rPPG-based methods achieve promising results on both intra and cross dataset scenarios, they may not be robust enough when rPPG signals are contaminated by noise. In this paper, we propose a new liveness feature, called rPPG correspondence feature (CFrPPG) to precisely identify the heartbeat vestige from the observed noisy rPPG signals. To further overcome the global interferences, we propose a novel learning strategy which incorporates the global noise within the CFrPPG feature. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed feature not only outperforms the state-of-the-art rPPG based methods on 3D mask attacks but also be able to handle the practical scenarios with dim light and camera motion. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB This paper presents a blinking-based liveness detection method for human face using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). Our method only needs a web camera for capturing video clips. Blinking clue is a passive action and does not need the user to to any hint, such as speaking, face moving. We model blinking activity by CRFs, which accommodates long-range contextual dependencies among the observation sequence. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is promising, and outperforms the cascaded Adaboost method and HMM method. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

AB Most of the generic camera based biometrics systems, such as face recognition systems, are vulnerable to print/photo attacks. Spoof detection, which is to discriminate between live biometric information and attacks, has received increasing attentions recently. However, almost all the previous studies have not concerned the influence of the image distortion caused by the camera defocus or hand movements during image capturing. In this research, we first investigate local texture based anti-spoofing methods including existing popular methods (but changing some of the parameters) by using publicly available spoofed face/finger photo/video databases. Secondly, we investigate the spoof detection under the camera defocus or hand movements during image capturing. To simulate image distortion caused by camera defocus or hand movements, we create blurred test images by applying image filters (Gaussian blur or motion blur filters) to the test datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that modifications of the existing methods (LBP, LPQ, DCNN) or the parameter tuning can achieve less than 1/10 of HTER（half total error rate）compared to the existing results. Among the investigated methods, the DCNN (AlexNet) can achieve the stable accuracy under the increasing intensity of the blurring noises.

AB This paper is concerned with biometrie spoofing detection using the dynamics of natural facial movements as a feature. Facial muscle movement information can be extracted from video sequences and encoded using the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). The proposed feature constructs a Facial Action Units Histogram (FAUH) to encapsulate this information for the detection of biometric presentation attacks without the need for active user cooperation. The performance of the proposed system was tested on two datasets: CASIA-FASD and Replay Attack and produced encouraging results. Further improvements may be possible by integrating this source of information with other indicators for further protecting biometric systems from subversion. © 2017 IEEE.

AB Biometric systems are growingly used for authentication purposes in various security applications. Face, Fingerprint and Iris are the biometric modalities commonly used in the authentication systems. Simplicity of use, reliability and uniqueness are important characteristics of biometric based authentications. This kind of techniques can solve the typical problem of systems based on use of password which can be forgotten or stolen. Biometric systems plays a significant role in personal, national, and global security. Despite the increase in usage of biometric based systems, these are quiet susceptible to sophisticated spoofing attacks. Various spoofing attacks are present to defeat such biometric authentication systems. To improve the level of security, it is necessary to augment the reliable liveness detection tools as software modules along with the existing authentication systems. This paper targets the countermeasures for the biometric spoofing attacks and also suggests technical measures for implementing the biometric liveness detection systems. The research in this field is very active, with local descriptors. In order to overcome the shortcomings of already existing liveness detection tools, in this work we propose two different feature extraction techniques for software-based liveness detection: Convolutional Networks and Local Binary Patterns. Both techniques were used in conjunction with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Dataset Augmentation was used to increase classifier's performance and a variety of preprocessing operations were tested, such as frequency filtering, contrast equalization, and region of interest filtering. © 2017 IEEE.

AB Attacks on authentication services are major security concerns. Password-based authentication systems can be compromised using known techniques, such as brute force and dictionary-based attacks. Biometric-based authentication systems are becoming the preferred choice to replace password-based authentication systems. Among several variations of biometrics (e.g., face, eye, fingerprint), iris-based authentication is commonly used in various applications. In iris-based authentication systems, iris images from legitimate users are captured and certain features are extracted to be used for matching during the authentication process. Literature works suggest that iris-based authentication systems can be subject to presentation attacks where an attacker obtains printed copy of the victim's eye image and displays it in front of an authentication system to gain unauthorized access. Such attacks can be performed by displaying static eye images on mobile devices or ipads (known as screen attacks). Since human iris features so not changed, once the iris image is compromised, it is hard to avoid this type of attack. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a framework for iris code generation by considering the changes of the area between the pupil and the sclera due to light density level. The proposed approach relies on capturing iris images using near infrared light. We train HaarCascade and LBP classifiers to capture the area between the pupil and the cornea. The image of iris is then stored in the database. This approach also generates a QR code from the iris. The code acts as a password and the user is required to provide it during authentication. A prototype is built using OpenCV platform tool. The prototype has been tested using samples obtained from publicly available iris database. The initial results show that the proposed approach has lower false positive and false negative rates. © 2017 IEEE.

AB Today iris recognition systems are extensively used for security and authentication purposes due to their simplicity and high reliability. But these systems face a major challenge of being spoofed by high quality printed iris images or pictures captured by camera. The problem is aggravated by use of varying illumination conditions in an attack access attempt. This paper investigates spoofing attempts and suggests a simple approach based on statistical parameters to counter against such attacks in the event of varying illumination sources. Self Quotient Image (SQI) is used to combat varying lighting conditions. A feature score is computed based on the statistical parameters. A binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used to classify the image under test as real or spoof by matching the feature score of the trained images to that of the test image. The experimental results show that the proposed method performs better than other state-of-the-art techniques. © 2016 IEEE.

AB OBJECTIVE: Limited data exist on familial moyamoya in children. The purpose of this study was to characterize presentation and outcomes of pediatric moyamoya patients who have relatives diagnosed with moyamoya. METHODS: The authors performed a single-institution retrospective analysis of a case series including all surgically treated children with moyamoya with first- or second-degree relatives with moyamoya. Clinical and radiographic characteristics were analyzed, along with surgical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 537 patients underwent surgery for moyamoya during the study period. Eighteen of those patients (3.4% of the total series) had moyamoya and a family history of moyamoya and were included in this study. Of these 18 patients, 14 were non-twin siblings, and the remaining 4 represented 2 pairs of identical (affected) twins. The presentation was predominantly ischemic (72%), but 4 patients (33%) were asymptomatic when they were found to have moyamoya. Bilateral disease was present in 13 patients (72%). Radiographic stroke prevalence (67%), Suzuki grade (3.3), and angiographic fndings were comparable to findings in nonfamilial moyamoya patients. Thirty revascularization procedures were performed, with a 3.3% operative stroke rate per hemisphere and no new strokes in an average follow-up period of 4.5 years. CONCLUSIONS: In a North American surgical series, familial moyamoya existed in 3.4% of cases, and was distinguished by manifesting in a broad range of ethnic groups, with a higher proportion of male patients and increased rates of asymptomatic and unilateral disease in comparison to nonfamilial moyamoya. Screening indications remain controversial and the current data are used to suggest guidelines. Surgical therapy is warranted, effective, and durable in these patients, but patients should be carefully selected. © A ANS, 2017.

AB Biometric system is widely used to recognize the authorized person based on either behavioral characteristics or physical. But this can be spoofed using various traits. Spoofing attack is nothing but attacking or harming biometric recognition system using security features to use system without permission of authorized user. These biometric systems can be easily attacked by spoofs like peoples face images, masks and videos which are easily available from social media. In the proposed work, method is discuss to detect the spoofing attack. Spoofing methods like photo, mask or video image can be easily recognized by this method. This method depends on illumination and some other characteristics of face which are used to detect spoofed face. The goal of this work is to develop a efficient protection method against these types of attacks. By last, proposed work efficiently detects the live face using illumination characteristics in MATLAB tool. © 2016 IEEE.

AB A person intentionally concealing or faking their identity from biometric security systems is known to perform a 'presentation attack'. Efficient presentation attack detection poses a challenging problem in modern biometric security systems. Sophisticated presentation attacks may successfully spoof a person's face and therefore, disrupt accurate biometric authentication in controlled areas. In this work, a presentation attack detection technique which processes biologically-inspired facial features is introduced. The main goal of the proposed method is to provide an alternative foundation for biometric detection systems. In addition, such a system can be used for future generation biometric systems capable of carrying out rapid facial perception tasks in complex and dynamic situations. The newly-developed model was tested against two different databases and classifiers. Presentation attack detection results have shown promise, exceeding 94% detection accuracy on average for the investigated databases. The proposed model can be enriched with future enhancements that can further improve its effectiveness and complexity in more diverse situations and sophisticated attacks in the real world. © 2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

AB Face recognition is an increasingly popular technology for user authentication. However, face recognition is susceptible to spoofing attacks. Therefore, a reliable way to detect malicious attacks is crucial to the robustness of the face recognition system. This paper describes a new approach to utilizing light field camera for defending spoofing face attacks, like (warped) printed 2D facial photos and high-definition tablet images. The light field camera is a sensor that can record the directions as well as the colors of incident rays. Needing only one snapshot, multiple refocused images can be generated. In the proposed method, three kinds of features extracted from a pair of refocused images are extracted to discriminate fake faces and real faces. To verify the performance, we build a light field photograph databases and conduct experiments. Experimental results reveal that the employed features can achieve remarkable anti-spoofing accuracy under different types of spoofing attacks. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB Multi-modal biometric verification systems are in active development and show impressive performance nowadays. However, such systems need additional protection from spoofing attacks. In our paper we present full pipeline of anti-spoofing method (based on our previous work) for bimodal audiovisual verification system. This method allows to evaluate parameters of quality for a sequence of face images during a verification process. Based on this parameters it’s decided whether the data is suitable for processing by the standard method (fiducial points based audiovisual liveness detection, FALD). If the quality of data is not sufficient, then our system switches to a new algorithm (svm-based audiovisual liveness detection, SALD), which provides less protection quality, but is able to operate when FALD is unsuitable. To improve the quality of the FALD algorithm we have collected the special dataset. This dataset allows to get better reliability of the algorithm for searching of fiducial points on the user’s face image. Tests show that developed system can significantly improve the quality of anti-spoofing protection versus our previous work. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Atrial myxomas are rare cardiac tumors that may cause neurological complications; however, delayed neurological events after total tumor resection are rare. In this report, we present a patient who developed transient cerebral ischemic attacks and was found to have multiple intracranial aneurysms 5 years after successful resection of her atrial myxoma. At the time of myxoma resection, there were no neurological symptoms; at the time of presentation with transient ischemic attacks, there was no evidence of atrial recurrence. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old woman presented with five episodes of right arm and face paresthesia, each lasting 15 to 20 minutes, 5 years after successful resection of her atrial myxoma. Clopidogrel bisulfate therapy was initiated, with resolution of her symptoms. Angiography revealed multiple, peripherally located, fusiform cerebral aneurysms. INTERVENTION: A left frontal craniotomy for resection and biopsy of one of the aneurysms was performed, to establish the diagnosis. Pathological analysis of the biopsied aneurysm provided evidence of direct atrial myxoma invasion and occlusion of the cerebral blood vessel. CONCLUSION: Neurological symptoms may accompany or lead to the diagnosis of atrial myxoma. Rarely, as in this case, myxomatous aneurysms may develop years after definitive treatment of the primary tumor. Patients who have undergone successful resection of a left atrial myxoma may be at risk for delayed cerebral ischemia associated with aneurysm development, and this phenomenon must be considered for patients with neurological symptoms who present even years after myxoma removal. The natural history, pathophysiological features, and treatment dilemma of these aneurysms are discussed.

AB This paper presents the pilot of a new Automatic Border Control system (ABC) that is being developed in the ABC4EU European project and that conform to the new laws established for the Schengen zone. These new ABCs have some specific characteristics, such as a structural configuration divided into two devices: selfenrolment kiosk and biometric gate, one for enrolment and the other one for verification, which entails two capture stages and two weaknesses where it is possible to attack the system. The tests were carried out with a pilot of the system, implemented at T4-S (T4 satellite) terminal of Adolfo Suárez Madrid-Barajas Airport. Our experiments have tested the security of the system by simulating several presentation attacks, at both stages of the system. For these attacks, different artefacts proposed in the literature about Presentation Attack Detection have been used. We present the obtained results with each of the attacks, indicating which may be more dangerous to the system and suggesting some countermeasure that could increase the reliability and security of the system.

AB Purpose - Biometric systems are widely used for face recognition. They have rapidly developed in recent years. Compared with other approaches, such as fingerprint recognition, handwriting verification and retinal and iris scanning, face recognition is more straightforward, user friendly and extensively used. The aforementioned approaches, including face recognition, are vulnerable to malicious attacks by impostors; in such cases, face liveness detection comes in handy to ensure both accuracy and robustness. Liveness is an important feature that reflects physiological signs and differentiates artificial from real biometric traits. This paper aims to provide a simple path for the future development of more robust and accurate liveness detection approaches. Design/methodology/approach - This paper discusses about introduction to the face biometric system, liveness detection in face recognition system and comparisons between the different discussed works of existing measures. Originality/value - This paper presents an overview, comparison and discussion of proposed face liveness detection methods to provide a reference for the future development of more robust and accurate liveness detection approaches. © 2017 Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB Biometrie security depends on its accuracy and efficiency, but is especially vulnerable to spoof attacks. Currently liveness detection has become the standard method of reducing the impact of spoof attacks, however whilst this protects against spoof creation and presentation, it does nothing to detect legitimate users being coerced into accessing systems. This paper looks at this coercion concept, indicating the impact coercion could have on biometric security and how it can be detected. This paper will identify scenarios in which coercion detection could improve security as well as identifying the underlying concepts that make this area up, culminating in the presentation of four high level techniques which can be implemented within a multi-modal biometric system to detect coercion detection. © 2016 IEEE.

AB Human mouth is very flexible such that its status (closed or open) is often used as a judgment in the liveness detection of face recognition. However, due to large head pose and illumination variations, accurate mouth status estimation is still challenging in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) method for mouth status estimation under unconstrained conditions and different types of attacks. Different from previous methods that extract hand-crafted features and then treat the estimation problem as a binary classification task, our method automatically extracts discriminative features via learned convolutional and the pooling layers. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and the challenge of mouth status estimation in real-world, we also propose a mouth status estimation dataset that contains 10,714 images in the wild. Experimental results with two types of liveness attacks show that our proposed method outperforms the other traditional methods, especially in the wild condition. © 2016 IEEE.

DE 3D mask; Face authentication; Facial vital signs; Spoofing attacks;
AB Vulnerability to spoofing attacks is the main drawback for current face authentication systems. Traditional spoofing attacks include displaying printed photos and replaying recorded videos. With the development of 3D printing technology, the 3D mask spoofing attack has been becoming the new threat. A novel anti-spoofing feature was proposed to 3D mask attacks. A liveness feature from the power spectrum of facial color signal was extracted based on a physiological phenomenon that the color of real human face changed periodically due to the blood circulation. The performance of countermeasure jointly using the liveness feature and facial texture feature was evaluated on a public database named 3D Mask Attack Database (3DMAD) and achieved a higher accuracy comparing to previous methods that only considered texture features. © 2016, The Editorial Board of Journal of System Simulation.

AB This paper describes biometric liveness establishment in support of server-side authentication computation on user face data, as captured on client-side apparatus, via a bidirectional user-to-server challenge-response interaction. We propose for server-side issue of a random challenge, with the user undertaking verbal delivery of the response into aforesaid capture apparatus. This spoken input is subject to speaker-independent speech decoding, on the client-side platform, for extraction of the response numeric or symbolic valuation, which is then transmitted to the authentication server. Computation undertaken on this challenge-response pair, as specific to user interaction of interest, would then result in a test authenticator, which is then verified against some user-specific reference valuation as previously established during initial user enrolment. This user-specific authenticator, as presumed secret and exclusive to particular user, can furthermore be used in support of biometric salting as used to generate a secure biometric template. These templates would constitute a cancellable biometric, allowing for credential management processes equivalent to those undertaken on user-specific passwords or physical tokens, and furthermore preserving the privacy of the underlying biometric data. © 2016 IEEE.

AB In this paper, we present a novel face spoofing detection method based on 3D lighting environment analysis of an image pair collected before and after the lighting environment change. Our idea is inspired from the unimpressive fact that the illumination distributions of the internal spoof face stays stable under the protection of the photo and screen plane, while that of a exposed genuine face changes accordingly to different lighting environment due to a natural response of 3D structure. After estimating two sets of lighting environment coefficients of client's face image pair with the hand of 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) and Sphere Harmonic Illumination Model (SHIM), robust liveness judgement is conducted by hypothesis tests. Experimental results show the effectiveness of proposed method on multiple kinds of face attacks including printed photo, screen photo, and video replay attack, and other advantages such as user cooperation free, loose using conditions, simple equipment demand, easy to camouflage and propitious to face recognition. © 2016 IEEE.

AB This paper proposes a face recognition system with liveness and threat detection on smartphone. Liveness and under-threat situations are decided through eye-blinking and facial expressions. It is designed to handle resource constraints of mobile devices such as low processing power, limited memory, less battery power and low quality of images. It uses Uniform Extended Local Ternary Pattern (UELTP) features for the threat detection. Whereas, Uniform Local Binary Pattern (ULBP) and Binarized Hamming Distance (BHD) are used for liveness detection. The experiments have been conducted on three in-house databases called SmartBioVideo, SmartBioFace and SmartBioThreatFace. Results have found to be promising and time efficient. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB Objective: To describe a case of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) comorbid with Melkersson-Rosenthal Syndrome (MRS). Methods: We present a case study of comorbid OCD and MRS in a 13-year-old girl. Results: She admitted to doubt obsessions and a control compulsion. The patient history included frequent facial palsy attacks, and she took prednisolone during each attack. She had her first such attack at 5 years of age, and she had suffered five attacks since then, the last one occurring 2 months before her presentation. Her obsessions began 1 week after the last attack. She was diagnosed MRS and concurrent OCD based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, diagnostic criteria. She was started on 20 mg/day fluoxetine. The control compulsion subsided during the second month of therapy, and the doubt obsessions improved significantly. Conclusion: Considering that the etiologies of MRS and childhood-onset OCD have been attributed to infectious agents and autoimmune events, we conclude that both causes may play an important role in the etiology of these conditions. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB The following paper presents a simple and fast liveness detection method based on gaze direction estimation under a challenge-response user authentication scenario. To estimate a line of sight, a procedure composed of several steps, including face and eye detection, derivation of gaze direction representation and subsequent classification, has been proposed. The proposed, novel gaze orientation descriptor is easy to compute and it provides sufficiently accurate estimates for the considered task. To assess a probability of genuine biometric trait presentation, recorded gaze direction responses induced by presentation of a randomly generated on-screen object, are matched against expected patterns. © 2015, IEEE.

AB This review attempts to show that there may be a relationship between inflamma-tory processes induced by chronic overstimulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and the worldwide deficiency of vitamin D (VitD) and that both disorders are probably associated with environmental factors. Low VitD levels represent a risk factor for several apparently different diseases, such as infectious, autoimmune, neu-rodegenerative, and cardiovascular diseases, as well as diabetes, osteoporosis, and cancer. Moreover, VitD insufficiency seems to predispose to hypertension, metabolic syndrome, left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, and chronic vascular inflamma-tion. On the other hand, inappropriate stimulation of the RAS has also been associated with the pathogenesis of hypertension, heart attack, stroke, and hypertrophy of the left ventricle and vascular smooth muscle cells. Because VitD receptors (VDRs) and RAS receptors are almost distributed in the same tissues, a possible link between VitD and the RAS is even more plausible. Furthermore, from an evolutionary point of view, both systems were developed simultaneously, actively participating in the regulation of inflammatory and immunological mechanisms. Changes in RAS activity and activation of the VDR seem to be inversely related; thus any changes in one of these systems would have a completely opposite effect on the other, making it possible to speculate that the two systems could have a feedback relationship. In fact, the pandemic of VitD deficiency could be the other face of increased RAS activity, which probably causes lower activity or lower levels of VitD. Finally, from a therapeutic point of view, the combination of RAS blockade and VDR stimulation appears to be more effective than either RAS blockade or VDR stimulation individually. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.

DE Anti-colonialism; Edward Said; Orientalism; Postcolonialism; Zionism;
AB This plenary presentation eulogizes Edward Said and speaks to his courage, passion, and scholarship, while simultaneously acknowledging his discomfort with the problematic category of "great men." Shohat traces Said's early scholarship, the vitriolic backlash against his words, and the way his work consolidated what would, a decade later, become the fields of postcolonial studies and cultural studies. Shohat's presentation then delves into the circulation and reception of his critique of Orientalism as an example of "traveling theory." In Middle East studies, Said has been criticized as a deficient political scientist or historian or anthropologist, with critics ignoring the central concern of his work: the problem of representation and the necessity of a political critique that is also a cultural critique. In postcolonial studies in Israel, a certain post-Zionist discourse privileged Homi Bhabha's theories of hybridity, which were translated into Hebrew, over Said's notyet-translated and allegedly binaristic notions of coloniality. In the final moments of the presentation, Shohat reflects on her friendship with Edward Said, remembering his courage in the face of consistent attacks and his willingness to inhabit the ever-uncomfortable space of the worldly yet "out-of- place" intellectual. © University of Toronto Press.

DE Avulsive; Facial; Human bite; Treatment;
AB Background: Human bite can be classified as occlusive or non-occlusive. Occlusive bites are seldom reported to occur outside the facial region. This study aims to analyze cases of avulsive human bite and find which part of the face is the most frequently involved in such cases. The findings may indicate which part of the face is generally perceived as the most critical in judging attractiveness.Methods: This retrospective study was carried out using a data review of all consecutive avulsive facial human bite cases seen in the maxillofacial surgery unit, National Hospital Abuja, between February 2001 and January 2014. Uniform protocol of prophylactic oral antibiotic and anti-tetanus cover was ensured throughout the study period.Results: Seventeen cases were included in this study. Amorous jealousy was the cause of altercation in 15 (88.2 %) cases. Twelve (70.6 %) cases involved the lip. There were eight female and nine male victims. There were nine female and eight male assailants.Conclusions: The lip is the most frequently affected region of the face in avulsive human bite attacks in our environment. This may be because it is considered the most important anatomical region of the face on which judgment of attractiveness is based.Level of evidence: Level IV, prognostic/risk study. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB This paper proposes a method to detect face liveness against video replay attack. The live persons are distinguished from and video reply attack by analyzing the brightness difference on the face and background. By taking photos with/without a flashlight, the brightness differences of the face are compared with the one of the background. The live person and the attack should have different brightness differences. The accuracy on the liveness detection using the proposed model is satisfying in the experiments. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.

AB Face recognition technology has been applied extensively in many fields, such as biometric authentication. However, its application is not widely popularized since its anti-spoofing performance is very deficient. A real-time facial expression recognition algorithm is proposed to realize face liveness detection in this paper, and the anti-spoofing performance can be effectively enhanced. After the face and the preset facial expression are properly recognized, the algorithm requires the user to change to another randomly designated expression. According to the second facial expression recognition result, it can judge the face image whether is captured from a live face. The four facial expressions, which have high recognition rate and the user is willing to accept and easily represent, are selected to verify the validity of the algorithm. The experiment shows the algorithm can effectively prevent the spoof attacks using photo, 3D model and video. © 2014 Binary Information Press

AB One of underused biometric methods is the face recognition based on thermal images. Nevertheless, in the applications such as liveness detection or fever scan, the thermal face recognition is used as a standalone module, or as a part of a multimodal biometric system. This article presents an overview and comparison of various statistical methods for thermal facial image analysis and recognition. It also proposes an approach to fusion of some methods to improve the overall performance. © 2012 IEEE.

AB Stroke and heart attack, which could be led by a kind of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease named asatherosclerosis, would seriously cause human morbidity and mortality. And the carotid artery of intima-media thickness (IMT) is a key indicator to the disease. With the development of computer assisted diagnosis (CAD) technology, Ultrasound imaging, being real-time, economic, reliable, safe, and now seems to become a standard in vascular assessment methodology especially for the measurement of IMT. This review is an attempt to discuss the clinical relevance of measurements in clinical practice at first, and then followed by the challenges that one has to face when approaching the segmentation of ultrasound images. Secondly, the paper is presentation of common used methods for the IMT segmentation and measurement. An overview of summary and future perspectives is given in conlusion finally. © 2011 IEEE.

AB INTRODUCTION: We present 2 cases of transient global amnesia (TGA) with delays of 1 and 2 hours after saline-contrast transthoracic echocardiography. The unique presentation in these cases may help elucidate the possible mechanisms underlying TGA. CASES: (1) A 63-year-old woman admitted for lower extremity arterial thrombosis with TGA onset 1 hour after saline-contrast echocardiography. (2) A 75-year-old woman admitted to rule out myocardial infarction with TGA onset 2 hours after saline-contrast echocardiography. CONCLUSIONS: The precipitating events of TGA are varied and an understanding of the mechanism(s) underlying the phenomenon is incomplete. However, the presence of a delay after the trigger event as described in these cases is unique and informative in that it lends strength to some proposed mechanisms over others in this subset of TGA presentations. © 2011 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB Morbus Morbihan is also described as a chronic lymphedema related to rosacea and characterized with hard nonpitting edema localized to the upper central face clinically. The other typical features are nonpathologic laboratory and histopathological findings and resistance to various therapies. Forty-three years old female patient applied to the outpatient clinic with a persistant edema present for 5 years involving the upper lip, chin and cheeks. A diagnosis of rosaceous lymphedema (Morbus Morbihan) with atypical presentation was made on the ground of patient history, clinical examination and histopathological findings. The patient was prescribed to use topical and oral metronidazole and diuretic. Erythematous edema attacks completely stopped and facial erythematous edema decreased significantly. The involvement of lower face in our patient is interesting. Topical and oral metronidazole along with oral diuretic was efficacious in the treatment of our Morbus Morbihan case.

AB Biometrics is a unique area of multidisciplinary engineering practice. We address this specific-application area in our classes on "Fundamentals of Biometric System Design" for the senior undergraduate electrical, computer, and software engineering students. This one-semester course covers various aspects of engineering design of biometric systems such as formulation and analysis of design goals, choosing computing platform, including application-specific DSP processors; modeling and prototyping; mitigating attacks using various design styles; and decision-making support in complex biometric-based systems. Ten basic labs support these topics using signal processing and pattern recognition in MATLAB, software for modeling the face, fingerprint and iris images, specific-application software such as Bayesian belief networks, and hardware such as cameras in visual and infrared bands. The course material consists of the textbook based on the lecture notes, instructor manual with solution to about 200 problems, as well as the collections of quizzes, examinations, and lecture presentations. © 2009 IEEE.

AB Multiple sclerosis (MS) was first described over 100 years ago, yet it remains unfamiliar to many clinicians. MS is a chronic, neurologic disorder that affects the central nervous system (CNS). It is characterized by the impairment of nerve transmission down the axon, attributed to chronic unpredictable inflammation and demyelination of neurons. In other words, unusual lesions damage the protective coat (myelin) of nerve fiber thus inhibiting the messages sent within the brain and to the spinal cord. Clinical presentation of MS is associated with exacerbations of weakness, imbalance/incoordination, spasticity, fatigue, bladder/bowel difficulties, vision loss, altered sensory perception, cognitive impairment, and neuropathic pain. Such signs and symptoms have a broad differential diagnosis, and therefore diagnosing MS is difficult when they initially present as an isolated clinical event. However, the clinical course over time - multifocal attacks, with an increasing burden of new demyelinative lesions seen on MRI scans and characteristic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings - enable the diagnosis to be made. Furthermore, there is no single test for MS, and diagnosis is based on a history of attacks (i.e. at least one month apart) and myelin destruction in moren than one area (i.e., brain and spinal cord). The treatment of MS is limited to treating exacerbations, managing symptoms, improving function, and using diseasemodifying drugs (DMDs). Treatment efforts are utilized in an attempt to improve the patient's quality of life. The cost of therapy can be substantial, since insurance companies may not cover the cost of DMDs without a firm diagnosis of clinically definite MS. The use of DMDs results in fewer new demyelinative lesions over time, but progressive neurologic disability is common. particularly when axonal degeneration occurs in response to chronic ongoing inflammation within the adjacent myelin sheath.

AB Liveness detection is an indispensable guarantee for reliable face recognition, which has recently received enormous attention. In this paper we propose three scenic clues, which are non-rigid motion, face-background consistency and imaging banding effect, to conduct accurate and efficient face liveness detection. Non-rigid motion clue indicates the facial motions that a genuine face can exhibit such as blinking, and a low rank matrix decomposition based image alignment approach is designed to extract this non-rigid motion. Face-background consistency clue believes that the motion of face and background has high consistency for fake facial photos while low consistency for genuine faces, and this consistency can serve as an efficient liveness clue which is explored by GMM based motion detection method. Image banding effect reflects the imaging quality defects introduced in the fake face reproduction, which can be detected by wavelet decomposition. By fusing these three clues, we thoroughly explore sufficient clues for liveness detection. The proposed face liveness detection method achieves 100% accuracy on Idiap print-attack database and the best performance on self-collected face anti-spoofing database. © 2012 IEEE.

AB We propose a high-performance low-complexity audio-visual person recognition framework suitable for on-line user authentication for various web-applications which delivers robustness against various types of imposter attacks by capturing face and speech dynamics from the video of the user. Instead of using the traditional frontal-face image, a set of compressed face profile vectors are extracted from multiple poses of the person. Similarly, multiple user-selected passwords are used to create robustness against imposter attacks. A novel FGRAM-CFD speech feature is proposed which captures the identity of the user from the speech dynamics contained in the password. The novel signal processing methods proposed here for speech and face feature-extraction led to high discriminative power of the combined audio-visual features. This allowed the classifier to remain simple, yet delivering a reasonably high performance at significantly low complexity as demonstrated by our trials on a 210-user audio-visual biometric database created for this research. ©2008 IEEE.

AB Liveness detection is increasingly planned to be incorporated into biometric systems to reduce the risk of spoofing and impersonation. Some of the techniques used include detection of motion of the head while posing/speaking, iris size in varying illumination, fingerprint sweat, textprompted speech, speech-to-lip motion synchronization etc. In this paper, we propose to build a biometric signal to test attack resilience of biometric systems by creating a text-driven video synthesis of faces. We synthesize new realistic looking video sequences from real image sequences representing utterance of digits. We determine the image sequences for each digit by using a GMM based speech recognizer. Then, depending on system prompt (sequence of digits) our method regenerates a video signal to test attack resilience of a biometric system that asks for random digit utterances to prevent play-back of pre-recorded data representing both audio and images. The discontinuities in the new image sequence, created at the connection of each digit, are removed by using a frame prediction algorithm that makes use of the well known block matching algorithm. Other uses of our results include web-based video communication for electronic commerce and frame interpolation for low frame rate video. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

AB Biometric devices have been suggested for use in applications from access to personal computers, automated teller machines, credit card transactions, and electronic transactions to access control for airports, nuclear facilities, and border control. Given this diverse array of potential applications, biometric devices have the potential to provide additional security over traditional security means such as passwords, keys, signatures, picture identification, etc. Examples of biometrics include recognition of a fingerprint, face, voice, iris, and handprint [1,2].

AB Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) is a rare disorder characterised by brief and frequent attacks of abnormal involuntary movements induced by sudden movement. This disorder has not been reported previously in Sri Lanka. We studied six patients with respect to clinical presentation, aetiology, family history and response to treatment, and describe the Sri Lankan patterns of this illness. All the patients were males and the age at onset was from 11 to 22 years. The involuntary movements in all were dystonic and affected one or both sides, involving the face in the majority. All had difficulty in speaking during the attacks. One patient had an occasional attack during exercise. In all, the illness was sporadic, none had a family history of a similar illness and in none was it due to a secondary cause. The attacks usually lasted 10-60 seconds, and occurred up to 20 times a day. All patients responded well to anticonvulsants. PKD in Sri Lanka has a pattern similar to that described worldwide.

AB When analysing a concurrent program in order to verify its correctness one faces a severe complexity problem: state-spaces corresponding to concurrent programs become tremendously large. To cope with this problem of state-space explosion, two different types of approaches have been established: abstraction techniques and partial-order methods. Abstraction aims at reducing the number of states by reducing the diversity of actions of a program. Partial-order methods reduce a state-space by ignoring particular interleavings of concurrent behavioural patterns. However, abstraction still faces the intricateness of an exhaustive state-space construction and partial-order methods, by ignoring certain patterns of actions, are not suitable for proving some property classes such as liveness properties. We combine in this paper abstraction with a partial-order approach. The aim is to use a partial-order method in the analysis phase of a concurrent program to construct only a reduced concrete state-space of the program. The reduced state-space then has to contain sufficient information about the program needed to construct the abstract state-space. The abstract state-space is then used to prove properties of the program. © 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB This article analyses the relationship between school atlases and school geography. In the relatively short existence of school atlases, they have been constantly adapted to the developments undergone in the teaching of geography. While this development affected mainly the contents and presentation of atlases in the early days, modern trends clearly point towards other teaching aids in addition to or instead of atlases. If school atlases are to survive this attack, they will have to provide 'ideal solutions' not provided by other sources. Moreover, they must fulfil their specific task and justify their purchase price. -Author

AB This paper explores the suitability of lip-based authentication as a behavioural biometric for mobile devices. Lip-based biometric authentication is the process of verifying an individual based on visual information taken from the lips while speaking. It is particularly suited to mobile devices because it contains unique information; its potential for liveness over existing popular biometrics such as face and fingerprint and lip movements can be captured using a device’s front-facing camera, requiring no dedicated hardware. Despite its potential, research and progress into lip-based biometric authentication has been significantly slower than other biometrics such as face, fingerprints, or iris.This paper investigates a state-of-the-art approach using a deep Siamese network, trained with the triplet loss for one-shot lip-based biometric authentication with real-world challenges. The proposed system, LipAuth, is rigourously examined with real-world data and challenges that could be expected on lip-based solution deployed on a mobile device. The work in this paper shows for the first time how a lip-based authentication system performs beyond a closed-set protocol, benchmarking a new open-set protocol with an equal error rates of 1.65% on the XM2VTS dataset.New datasets, qFace and FAVLIPS, were collected for the work in this paper, which push the field forward by enabling systematic testing of the content and quantities of data needed for lip-based biometric authentication and highlight problematic areas for future work. The FAVLIPS dataset was designed to mimic some of the hardest challenges that could be expected in a deployment scenario and include varied spoken content, miming and a wide range of challenging lighting conditions. The datasets captured for this work are available to other university research groups on request. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB Face presentation attack detection (PAD) has become a clear and present threat for face recognition systems and many countermeasures have been proposed to mitigate it. In these countermeasures, some of them use the features directly extracted from well-known color spaces (e.g., RGB, HSV and YCbCr) to distinguish the fake face images from the genuine (“live”) ones. However, the existing color spaces have been originally designed for displaying the visual content of images or videos with high fidelity and are not well suited for directly discriminating the live and fake face images. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a deep-learning system, called CompactNet, for learning a compact space tailored for face PAD. More specifically, the proposed CompactNet does not directly extract the features in existing color spaces, but inputs the color face image into a layer-by-layer progressive space generator. Then, under the optimization of the “points-to-center” triplet loss function, the generator learns a compact space with small intra-class distance, large inter-class distance and a safe interval between different classes. Finally, the feature of the image in compact space is extracted by a pre-trained feature extractor and used for image classification. Reported experiments on three publicly available face PAD databases, namely, the Replay-Attack, the OULU-NPU and the HKBU-MARs V1, show that CompactNet separates very well the two classes of fake and genuine faces and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for PAD. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB F Face recognition has been widely used in modern intelligent systems, such as smart video surveillance, online payment, and intelligent access control system. Existing face recognition algorithms are prone to be attacked by various face presentation attacks (face-PAs), such as printed paper, video replay, and silicone masks. To optimally handle the aforementioned problems, we formulate a novel deep architecture to increase the accuracy of multi-view human face recognition. In particular, in the first place, a novel deep neural network is built for deeply encoding the face regions, where a novel face alignment algorithm is employed to localize the key points inside faces. Subsequently, we utilize the well-known PCA for reducing the dimensionality of the deep features and simultaneously, removing the redundant and contaminated visual features. Thereafter, we propose a joint Bayesian framework in order to evaluate the similarity of feature vectors and highly competitive face classification accuracy can be achieved. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on our compiled CAS-PEAL dataset and achieved a 98.52% face recognition performance. Moreover, our proposed face recognition system can robustly handle various face recognition attack under various contexts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB In the race of arms between attackers, trying to build more and more realistic face replay attacks, and defenders, deploying spoof detection modules with ever-increasing capabilities, CNN-based methods have shown outstanding detection performance thus raising the bar for the construction of realistic replay attacks against face-based authentication systems. Rather than trying to rebroadcast even more realistic faces, we show that attackers can successfully fool a face authentication system equipped with a deep learning spoof detection module, by exploiting the vulnerabilities of CNNs to adversarial perturbations. We first show that mounting such an attack is not a trivial task due to the unique features of spoofing detection modules. Then, we propose a method to craft adversarial images that can be successfully exploited to build an effective replay attack. Experiments conducted on the REPLAY-MOBILE database demonstrate that our attacked images achieve good performance against a face recognition system equipped with CNN-based anti-spoofing, in that they are able to pass the face detection, spoof detection and face recognition modules of the authentication chain. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB The deployment of fingerprint sensors is increasingly becoming common and has now gained high user acceptance. However, fingerprint sensors are susceptible to spoofing using artificial materials or in worst case to the dismembered fingers. Fake/gummy fingerprints have shown to fool most commercial fingerprint systems. This paper proposes a new method of anti-spoofing using reliable liveness detection. The proposed method of liveness detection is based on the principle of pulse oximetry and involves the source of light originating from a probe at two wavelengths. The light is partly absorbed by haemoglobin, by amounts which differ depending on whether it is saturated with oxygen or deoxygenated haemoglobin. We then perform the computations for the absorption at two wavelengths to estimate the proportion of haemoglobin which is oxygenated. The computed percentage of oxygen in the blood, along with the heart pulse rate, determines the liveness of the enrolled biometric. Our experimental results demonstrate that the developed prototype can successfully thwart the spoof attacks (including those based on dismembered fingers). © 2008 IEEE.

AB In this paper we propose a novel approach for face anti-spoofing called extended local ternary co-relation pattern (ELTCP). The ELTCP encodes co-relation of ternary edges based on the centre pixel gray values with its immediate directional neighbour and its next immediate directional neighbour. The proposed method is robust against presentation attacks by extracting the spatial information in all the directions. Three Experiments were performed by using all the four texture descriptors (LBP, LTP, LGS and ELTCP) and the results are compared. The proposed face anti-spoofing method performs better than LBP, LTP and LGS. © 2020

AB In this case study, we present a 21 years old female with long-standing Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) who, following a sexual assault, also developed Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), leading to a change in her seizure semiology. The new seizures seemed to be a re-enactment of the sexual assault and accordingly were at first thought to be Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES). Nevertheless, electroencephalography (EEG) recording at the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) revealed ictal epileptic brain activity during these new attacks. In order to further explore the nature of the relation between epileptic seizures and PTSD symptomatology, a functional MRI (fMRI) scan was conducted focusing on neural response to threat (fearful faces). The results indicated that the response to threat elicited bilateral amygdala activation, as well as enhanced amygdala connectivity with the insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), all central nodes of the fear circuitry. Accordingly, we suggest that this unique presentation of “pseudo” PNES might stem from the anatomical proximity of the epileptic network in this patient (temporal-insular-frontal) to the fear circuitry, allowing abnormal epileptic activity to “exploit” or activate the fear circuit or vice versa. We further propose that the traumatic experience may have changed the patient’s ictal semiology by modifying the course of the spread of the ictal activity toward the PTSD network. © Copyright © 2020 Biran, Admon, Gazit and Fahoum.

AB In order to improve the security of the face recognition system and prevent from fake face attack in mobile phones and photos, a face anti-spoofing algorithm based on semantic segmentation is proposed. First, the local face region is semantically segmented by full convolutional neural network (FCNN), and the convolution kernel with direction is proposed to optimize the network. Secondly, a fast classifier is trained to classify the results of the semantic segmentation network. Finally, the deep learning network is connected in series to form an end-to-end face anti-spoofing framework. The test results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is outstanding in the Casia live dataset and private dataset collected by CBPM-XINDA, and the generalization ability in the actual project is outstanding. The main work includes the production of data sets and the selection of features (using the combination of deep learning and automatic learning features and manual selection of features), and proposes a method for optimizing convolution kernels and concatenation of multiple networks. © 2020, Jilin University Press.

AB Face presentation attacks have become a major threat against face recognition systems and many countermeasures have been proposed over the past decade. However, most of them are devoted to 2D face presentation attack detection, rather than 3D face masks. Unlike the real face, the 3D face mask is usually made of resin materials and has a smooth surface, resulting in reflectance differences. Therefore, in this study, the authors propose a novel 3D face mask presentation attack detection method based on analysis of image reflectance. In the proposed method, the face image is first processed with intrinsic image decomposition algorithm to compute its reflectance image. Then, the intensity distribution histograms are extracted from three orthogonal planes to represent the intensity differences of reflectance images between the real face and 3D face mask. After that, given that the reflectance image of a smooth surface is more sensitive to illumination changes, 1D convolutional neural network is used to characterise how different materials or surfaces react differently to illumination changes. Extensive experiments with the public available 3DMAD database demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for distinguishing a face mask from the real one and show that the detection performance outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020.

AB Millions of passengers travel every day, border crossing being one of their most common activities. At these points it is extremely important that security is completely guaranteed. However, the maintaining adequate security levels is a very demanding issue. This has promoted the development of systems capable of providing support to border authorities by automatising some of their tasks. Thus, Automated Border Control (ABC) systems have become a key tool. These systems increase the flow of travellers as they can achieve fast evaluations of individuals through their machine-readable travel documents. However, this has motivated the appearance of attacks that try to avoid the identity detection of individuals by these systems. Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) algorithms have emerged to mitigate such a problem. This paper presents the On-the-Fly Presentation Attack Detection (FlyPAD) framework that implements a set of dynamic PAD techniques. It allows multiple types of attacks to be detected as the traveller approaches the ABC system, rather than being static in front of the cameras. Several experiments have been carried out, both in the laboratory and in real environments, obtaining promising results. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB Although face-based biometric recognition systems have been widely used in many applications, this type of recognition method is still vulnerable to presentation attacks, which use fake samples to deceive the recognition system. To overcome this problem, presentation attack detection (PAD) methods for face recognition systems (face-PAD), which aim to classify real and presentation attack face images before performing a recognition task, have been developed. However, the performance of PAD systems is limited and biased due to the lack of presentation attack images for training PAD systems. In this paper, we propose a method for artificially generating presentation attack face images by learning the characteristics of real and presentation attack images using a few captured images. As a result, our proposed method helps save time in collecting presentation attack samples for training PAD systems and possibly enhance the performance of PAD systems. Our study is the first attempt to generate PA face images for PAD system based on CycleGAN network, a deep-learning-based framework for image generation. In addition, we propose a new measurement method to evaluate the quality of generated PA images based on a face-PAD system. Through experiments with two public datasets (CASIA and Replay-mobile), we show that the generated face images can capture the characteristics of presentation attack images, making them usable as captured presentation attack samples for PAD system training. © 2020 by the authors.

AB Face is the most commonly used biometric these days due to its wide potential in numerous security applications. Spoofing attack is a fierce risk for security of face acknowledgment frameworks and can be limited by identifying face liveness. An innovative idea of detecting face liveness with facial thermography is presented in this paper. This paper is an effort to implement the incipient concept of face liveness detection approach by temperature sensation utilizing facial thermography. Computer Aided Face Liveness Detection Algorithm with facial thermography has been proposed. The proposed algorithm performs expeditious and precise analysis of the temperature distribution of individual face characteristic areas. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm significantly increases the security of face recognition system by detecting face liveness. The efficiency of the proposed method has been evaluated prosperously by considering facial thermograms of 100 subjects from In-House facial thermography dataset. Maximum reliability has been procured during face liveness detection with temperature sensation. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB Current state-of-the-art dual camera-based face liveness detection methods utilize either hand-crafted features, such as disparity, or deep texture features to classify a live face and face Presentation Attack (PA). However, these approaches limit the effectiveness of classifiers, particularly deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to unknown face PA in adverse scenarios. In contrast to these approaches, in this paper, we show that supervising a deep CNN classifier by learning disparity features using the existing CNN layers improves the performance and robustness of CNN to unknown types of face PA. For this purpose, we propose to supervise a CNN classifier by introducing a disparity layer within CNN to learn the dynamic disparity-maps. Subsequently, the rest of the convolutional layers, following the disparity layer, in the CNN are supervised using the learned dynamic disparity-maps for face liveness detection. We further propose a new video-based stereo face anti-spoofing database with various face PA and different imaging qualities. Experiments on the proposed stereo face anti-spoofing database are performed using various test case scenarios. The experimental results indicate that our proposed system shows promising performance and has good generalization ability. © 2019

AB To tackle the 3D mask face presentation attack, remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG), a biomedical technique that can detect heartbeat signal remotely, is employed as an intrinsic liveness cue. Although existing rPPG-based methods exhibit encouraging results, they require long observation time (10-12 seconds) to identify the heartbeat information, which limits their employment in real applications such as smartphone unlock and e-payment. To shorten the observation time (within 1-second) while keeping the performance, we propose a fast rPPG-based 3D mask presentation attack detection (PAD) method by analyzing the similarity of local facial rPPG signals in the time domain. In particular, a set of temporal similarity features of facial and background local rPPG signals are designed and fused to adapt the real world variations based on rPPG shape and phase properties. For better evaluation under practical variations, we build the HKBU-MARsV2+ dataset that includes 16 masks from 2 types and 6 lighting conditions. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on 11092 shortterm video slots from 4 datasets with a large number of real- world variations, in terms of mask type, lighting condition, camera, resolution of face region, and compression setting. Results show that the proposed TSrPPG outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors dramatically on discriminabil- ity and generalizability. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that addresses the length of observation time issue of rPPG-based 3D mask PAD. © 2020 IEEE.

AB Face authentication systems have gained widespread popularity because of their user-friendly usage and increasing recognition accuracy. Unfortunately, the boom in mobile social networks has bought with it media-based facial forgery; a critical threat where an adversary forges or replays the victim's photograph/video to fool the system. In this article, we propose EchoFace, an effective and robust liveness detection system to enhance face authentication in defending against media-based attacks, which works with today's smartphones/smartwatches without any hardware modification. EchoFace uses active acoustic sensing to differentiate the uneven stereostructure of the face and the flat forged media. Our proposed scheme effectively extracts the desired reflection profiles from the target. Moreover, we propose effective similarity measurements of reflection profiles to distinguish live users from forged media, which works robustly under various environmental conditions. EchoFace only requires low cost and universally equipped acoustic sensors without human intervention for liveness detection, which can be easily deployed in a variety of application scenarios. We implement EchoFace on commercial smartphones, and experiment results show that EchoFace achieves an average detection accuracy higher than 96% and false alarm rate lower than 4% across various media attacks and different levels of background noise. This shows its great potential to enhance the security of widely deployed face authentication systems in real scenarios. © 2014 IEEE.

AB In movies, film stars portray another identity or obfuscate their identity with the help of silicone/latex masks. Such realistic masks are now easily available and are used for entertainment purposes. However, their usage in criminal activities to deceive law enforcement and automatic face recognition systems is also plausible. Therefore, it is important to guard biometrics systems against such realistic presentation attacks. This paper introduces the first-of-its-kind silicone mask attack database which contains 130 real and attacked videos to facilitate research in developing presentation attack detection algorithms for this challenging scenario. Along with silicone mask, there are several other presentation attack instruments that are explored in literature. The next contribution of this research is a novel multilevel deep dictionary learning-based presentation attack detection algorithm that can discern different kinds of attacks. An efficient greedy layer by layer training approach is formulated to learn the deep dictionaries followed by SVM to classify an input sample as genuine or attacked. Experimental are performed on the proposed SMAD database, some samples with real world silicone mask attacks, and four existing presentation attack databases, namely, replay-Attack, CASIA-FASD, 3DMAD, and UVAD. The results show that the proposed algorithm yields better performance compared with state-ofthe-Art algorithms, in both intra-database and cross-database experiments. © 2017 IEEE.

DE Gradient amplitude feature; Polarization medium wave infra; Presentation attack detection; Three-dimensional silicone mas;
AB Facial recognition systems are often spoofed by presentation attack instruments (PAI), especially by the use of three-dimensional (3D) face masks. However, nonuniform illumination conditions and significant differences in facial appearance will lead to the performance degradation of existing presentation attack detection (PAD) methods. Based on conventional thermal infrared imaging, a PAD method based on the medium wave infrared (MWIR) polarization characteristics of the surface material is proposed in this paper for countering a flexible 3D silicone mask presentation attack. A polarization MWIR imaging system for face spoofing detection is designed and built, taking advantage of the fact that polarization-based MWIR imaging is not restricted by external light sources (including visible light and near-infrared light sources) in spite of facial appearance. A sample database of real face images and 3D face mask images is constructed, and the gradient amplitude feature extraction method, based on MWIR polarization facial images, is designed to better distinguish the skin of a real face from the material used to make a 3D mask. Experimental results show that, compared with conventional thermal infrared imaging, polarization-based MWIR imaging is more suitable for the PAD method of 3D silicone masks and shows a certain robustness in the change of facial temperature. © 2020 by the authors.

AB Face presentation attack detection methods based on deep learning have achieved noticeable results. However, such methods tend to over-emphasize a certain local area, which limits their performance against traditional attacks, and makes the system vulnerable to adversarial example attacks. To utilize more information of the input and enhance the robustness of face presentation attack detection methods against adversarial examples, this paper proposes multi-regional convolutional neural networks, and introduces the concept of local classification loss to local patches, so as to utilize the input information in the entire face region and to avoid over-emphasizing certain local areas. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is more robust against adversarial example attacks, and its performance against traditional attacks is also improved compared to existing methods. © 2020

AB Introduction: Craniodiaphyseal dysplasia is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder which is typically presented in infancy and characterised by severe form of bone dysplasia, massive bone sclerosis and hyperostosis. This process of bone changes characteristically affects the facial bones resulting in severe facial deformity. Case presentation: A-25-year-old girl who was diagnosed as a case of juvenile Paget's disease for 20 years presented with blurred vision, chronic headache and recurrent attacks of sinusitis. Re-evaluation of the patient was done and gene study was done which excluded Paget's disease. On the basis of her clinical examination and after exclusion of other possible causes the case was diagnosed as craniodiaphyseal dysplasia. Conclusion: Craniodiaphyseal dysplasia causes progressive facial bone enlargement and deformity with narrowing of the orifices of sinuses and compression on various cranial nerves due to narrowing of the cranial nerve openings. Multidisciplinary team is usually needed for the diagnosis and the management of this unusual diseases. Gene study must be done to confirm or exclude other rare genetic disorders. © 2019 The Authors

AB Purpose: This paper responds to a range of theory and industry reporting, to provide an informed narrative which explores the current state of accessibility at UK festivals for people who are Deaf or disabled and the potential implications of developments in ICT for enhancing design, marketing, operations and performances across all phases of festival delivery, in order to improve inclusivity and accessibility. To this end, the paper addresses the following question: What do representatives of the UK live music industry perceive as barriers to accessibility and exemplars of current best practice for music festival attendees who are Deaf or disabled? What do representatives of the UK live music industry consider as the role of ICT to increase accessibility for music festival attendees who are Deaf or disabled? Design/methodology/approach: Primary research focused on supply-side considerations with a sample group of 10 UK live music industry professionals. The scope of the research was limited geographically to England and by artform to open-air music festivals, venues which host some music festival provision and a Sector Support Organisation. Open questions elucidated qualitative information around; awareness of accessibility and inclusivity initiatives; potential for co-creation; non-digital improvements; current technological influences; and potential digital futures for accessible “live” experiences. A conceptual framework was constructed and semi-structured face-to-face interviews were carried out with six respondents, and four respondents completed a structured, self-administered e-mail questionnaire. Findings: Findings include: ICT can facilitate enhanced dialogue with existing and potential audience members who are Deaf or disabled to both; reduce existing social exclusion (Duffy et al., 2019) and improve the visitor experience for all attendees. All respondents agreed that physical enhancements are important and some mentioned communications and customer care. Respondents reported increasingly ambitious usages of ICT at music festivals, which may support suggestions of a virtual experience trend (Robertson et al., 2015). Online ticketing systems have potential to grant equal functionality to people who are Deaf or disabled, as recommended by the Department for Culture, Media & Sport (2015). Respondents broadly welcomed the potential for positive impacts of ICT on increasingly accessible live experiences at music festivals which retained a sense of authenticity and “liveness”. Challenges around “as live” ICT-derived experiences were identified including risks of creating second-class experiences for Deaf and disabled attendees. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of this case study include the s

AB As the technology is growing which is birth to different types of frauds into areas like face detection, finger print detection etc. Moreover, it becomes very difficult for service providers to maintain security of data. In addition, these systems needs to be protected from spoofing by attackers. Fraudsters can use dummy Eyes, photographs for identification of faces for authentication purposes. These facial recognitions can also be done through face detection from video streams by replaying videos capturing specific moments of person. Also these kind of attacks can be done successfully as system can't detect the real life faces faces extracted from videos photos. In addition, these videos photos will be easily available on internet other stored media, so anyone can challenge the system by using it. Now, many algorithms are implemented to detect face liveness for authentication. The paper represents novel face liveness detection using fusion of luminance-based features with help of assorted machine learning classifiers. © 2020 IEEE.

AB Face presentation attack detection (PAD) in unconstrained conditions is one of the key issues in face biometric-based authentication and security applications. In this paper, we propose a perturbation layer — a learnable pre-processing layer for low-level deep features — to enhance the discriminative ability of deep features in face PAD. The perturbation layer takes the deep features of a candidate layer in Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the corresponding hand-crafted features of an input image, and produces adaptive convolutional weights for the deep features of the candidate layer. These adaptive convolutional weights determine the importance of the pixels in the deep features of the candidate layer for face PAD. The proposed perturbation layer adds very little overhead to the total trainable parameters in the model. We evaluated the proposed perturbation layer with Local Binary Patterns (LBP), with and without color information, on three publicly available face PAD databases, i.e., CASIA, Idiap Replay-Attack, and OULU-NPU databases. Our experimental results show that the introduction of the proposed perturbation layer in the CNN improved the face PAD performance, in both intra-database and cross-database scenarios. Our results also highlight the attention created by the proposed perturbation layer in the deep features and its effectiveness for face PAD in general. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Many recent variational optical flow methods are not robust for illumination variance, and they only consider local image relation in terms of illumination. In this paper, we propose a new efficient illumination-invariance total variation optical flow method called the weighted regularization transform, which uses and optimizes the Weber's Law. Our method exploits unequal probability as the weight that has non-local information to estimate stable optical flow despite illumination changes. The proposed method uses a coarse-to-fine pyramid model to reduce the influence on the data term from illumination. Then, an energy optimization procedure is introduced to constrain the minimization of the data term with the non-local regularization. Experimentation with the proposed method has been performed on three optical flow datasets and a face liveness detection database, which have challenging illumination variations, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method is quite robust with respect to variations in illumination. © 1991-2012 IEEE.

AB Biometric authentication is used in Smart devices to lock and unlock devices instead of a PIN. However, using devices in uncontrolled environments is highly susceptible to spoofing by replay attacks. As an example of biometrics is a static face authentication, attackers use face images of spoofed persons to unlock devices, which leads to insecure operations and lack of confidential information without the owner’s knowledge. We have proposed a novel dynamic biometric authentication system (DBAS) based on capturing person eye-blinking movements of a person in addition to face authentication instead of using static face authentication. Proposed DBAS take a sequence of using images as input by asking the user to follow an eye-blink sequence. Then proposed DBAS unlock the mobile devices based on the correct eye-blink sequence made by the person. The test results show that our method is effective and robust for the screen unlocks on smart devices with 98.4% accuracy. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB Automatic face recognition is now widely used in applications ranging from deduplication of identity to authentication of mobile payment. This popularity of face recognition has raised concerns about face spoof attacks (also known as biometric sensor presentation attacks), where a photo or video of an authorized person's face could be used to gain access to facilities or services. While a number of face spoof detection techniques have been proposed, their generalization ability has not been adequately addressed. We propose an efficient and rather robust face spoof detection algorithm based on image distortion analysis (IDA). Four different features (specular reflection, blurriness, chromatic moment, and color diversity) are extracted to form the IDA feature vector. An ensemble classifier, consisting of multiple SVM classifiers trained for different face spoof attacks (e.g., printed photo and replayed video), is used to distinguish between genuine (live) and spoof faces. The proposed approach is extended to multiframe face spoof detection in videos using a voting-based scheme. We also collect a face spoof database, MSU mobile face spoofing database (MSU MFSD), using two mobile devices (Google Nexus 5 and MacBook Air) with three types of spoof attacks (printed photo, replayed video with iPhone 5S, and replayed video with iPad Air). Experimental results on two public-domain face spoof databases (Idiap REPLAY-ATTACK and CASIA FASD), and the MSU MFSD database show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in spoof detection. Our results also highlight the difficulty in separating genuine and spoof faces, especially in cross-database and cross-device scenarios. © 2015 IEEE.

AB Background and Purpose: Most guidelines now recommend that patients with minor stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) are assessed within 24 hours of their event, but the feasibility of this depends on patients behavior. We studied behavior immediately after TIA and minor stroke according to clinical characteristics, patients perception of the nature of the event, and their predicted stroke risk. Methods: In a population-based study in Oxfordshire, UK, with face-to-face interview of 1000 consecutive patients with TIA and minor stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ≥Currency sign5) from 2002 to 2007 (Oxford Vascular Study), we studied delay in seeking medical attention and identified patients who did not seek attention after an initial event and only presented after a recurrent stroke. RESULTS: Of 1000 patients (459 TIAs, 541 minor strokes), 300 (67%) with TIA and 400 (74%) with minor stroke sought medical attention within 24 hours and 208 (47%) and 234 (46%), respectively, sought attention within 3 hours. Most patients (77%) first sought attention through their primary care physician. In patients with TIA, incorrect recognition of symptoms, absence of motor or speech symptoms, shorter duration of event, lower ABCD2 score, no history of stroke or atrial fibrillation, and weekend presentation were associated with significantly longer delays. However, age, sex, social class, and educational level were all unrelated to either correct recognition of symptoms or to delay in seeking attention. Of 129 patients with TIA or minor stroke who had a recurrent stroke within 90 days, 41 (31%) did not seek medical attention after their initial event. These patients were more likely to have had a TIA (P≤0.003), shorter duration of event (P≤0.02), and a history of TIA (P≤0.09) and less likely to have had motor (P≤0.004) or speech symptoms (P≤0.04) compared with those patients who sought medical attention for their initial event. CONCLUSION: Approximately 70% of patients do not correctly recognize their TIA or minor stroke, 30% delay seeking medical attention for &gt;24 hours, regardless of age, sex, social class, or educational level, and approximately 30% of early recurrent strokes occur before seeking attention. Without more effective public education of all demographic groups, the full potential of acute prevention will not be realized. © 2010 American Heart Association, Inc.

AB Currently, the use of biometric identification, automated or semiautomated, is a reality. For this reason, the number of attacks has increased in such systems. One of the most common biometric attacks is the presentation attack (PA) because it is relatively easy to perform. Automated border control (ABC) is a clear target for phishers. Concerning biometric attacks, morphing is one of the most threatening attacks because authentication systems are usually unable to correctly detect them. In this attack, a fake face is generated with the morphing and blending of two different subjects (genuine and phisher), and the image result is stored in the passport. These attacks can generate risky situations in cases of border crossings where an ABC system should perform identification tasks. This research work proposes a de-morphing architecture that is founded on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. This technique is based on the use of two images: the potentially morphed image stored in the passport, and the snapshot of the person located in the ABC system. The goal of the de-morphing process is to unravel the chip image. If the chip image is a morphed one, the revealing process between the in vivo image and the morphed chip image will return a different facial identity to the person located in the ABC system, and the impostor will be uncovered in situ. If the chip image is a non-morphing image, the resulting image will be similar to a genuine passenger. Therefore, the information obtained is considered at the border crossing. The equal error rate (EER) achieved is very low compared to the literature values published to date. The accomplished outcomes endorse a robust method that provides high accuracy rates without taking into account the quality of images used. This key point is crucial to plausible deployment plans in areas such as ABC. © 2013 IEEE.

AB Reflection differences between live faces and spoof faces under near-infrared spectrum make near-infrared image based methods obtain superior performance for face anti-spoofing. However, for conventional face recognition systems, near-infrared image based methods need additional near-infrared equipment to capture the input near-infrared images. In this paper, we propose a novel face anti-spoofing method which exploits the clues in both visible light (VIS) images and near-infrared (NIR) images without utilizing any near-infrared equipment during testing. Specifically, we first propose a novel multiple categories image translation generative adversarial network (MCT-GAN) which generates corresponding NIR images for VIS live and spoof face images. Then we utilize convolution neural network to learn fusing features from both VIS images and corresponding generated NIR images for the goal of live and spoof face classification. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method obtains excellent results compared to the state-of-the-art methods. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB Face recognition systems have grown rapidly in a variety of applications recently, such as surveillance, access control, mobile payments, and forensic investigations. However, face recognition systems are highly likely to be deceived because imposters attempt to gain unauthorized access to the system by spoofing biometric data. In this paper, we proposed a multimodal presentation attack detection (PAD) method based on a challenge-response scenario. When the user speaks a word as required, the mouth movement is detected and the recognized speech is referenced to determine if the user is a real person or not. Two weighted score level fusion rules are adopted in the machine learning algorithm for training and testing. Experimental results show the proposed method is very effective in resisting photo-attack and video-attack targeting to face recognition systems. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB One of the most generally used framework to recognize the authorized person based on behavioral or physical characteristics is the Biometric system. One of the present issues with this system is that it can be easily spoofed. A spoofing attack is nothing but a situation in which a person or a program successfully identifies themselves as another person in order to use the system without the permission of authorized user thus harming or attacking the biometric recognition system. The biometric system can be easily spoofed by methods such as using face images of the authorized person, masks or videos which are easily available on social media these days. In this analysis, categorization of face liveness detection is done based on different techniques used for detecting spoofing attacks. This helps in inferring various developed solutions and spoofing attacks associated with them. An investigation of late examinations in the field of face liveness discovery has been laided to provide a simple and clear path for future improvement in the field of face liveness detection. © 2020, Hampstead Psychological Associates.

AB Liveness detection is a part of living biometric identification. While the face recognition system is promoted, it is also vulnerable to deceived and attacked from fake faces. Face liveness detection in traditional method needs network take long time to training and easy to appear over-fitting. Therefore, this paper proposed a Heterogeneous Kernel-Convolutional Neural Network (HK-CNN), the method replaces the standard convolutional kernel with heterogeneous convolutional kernel to detect the real face. In the two classic databases of NUAA and CASIA-FASD, the algorithm can improve accuracy and reduce the training cost of the model. Compared with traditional convolutional neural network methods, this algorithm has higher efficiency. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB In this paper, a face spoofing detection method called the Fully Convolutional Network with Domain Adaptation and Lossless Size Adaptation (FCN-DA-LSA) is proposed. As its name suggests, the FCN-DA-LSA includes a lossless size adaptation preprocessor followed by an FCN based pixel-level classifier embedded with a domain adaptation layer. The FCN local classifier makes full use of the basic properties of face spoof distortion namely ubiquitous and repetitive. The domain adaptation (DA) layer improves generalization across different domains. The lossless size adaptation (LSA) preserves the high-frequent spoof clues caused by the face recapture process. The ablation study shows that both DA and the LSA are necessary for high-accuracy face spoofing detection. The FCN-LSA obtains competitive performance among the state-of-the-art methods. With the help of small-sample external data in the target domain (2/50, 2/50, and 1/20 subjects for CASIA-FASD, Replay-Attack, and OULU-NPU respectively), the FCN-DA-LSA further improves the performance and outperforms the existing methods. © 2013 IEEE.

AB Face recognition systems are vulnerable to the presentation (or spoof or direct) attacks that can be carried out by presenting the face artefact corresponding to the legitimate user. Thus, it is essential to develop a Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) algorithms that can automatically detect the presentation attacks the face recognition systems. In this paper, we present a novel method for face presentation attack detection based on the multi-classifier fusion of deep features that are computed using the off-the-shelf pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture based on AlexNet. Extracted features are compared using softmax and Spectral Regression Kernel Discriminant Analysis (SRKDA) classifiers to obtain the comparison scores that are combined using a weighted sum rule. Extensive experiments are carried out on the publicly available OULU-NPU database and performance of the proposed method is benchmarked with fifteen different state-of-the-art techniques. Obtained results have indicated the outstanding performance of the proposed method on OULU-NPU database. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.

AB Presentation attack detection is a challenging problem that aims at exposing an impostor user seeking to deceive the authentication system. In facial biometrics systems, this kind of attack is performed using a photograph, video, or 3D mask containing the biometric information of a genuine identity. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detecting face presentation attacks based on intrinsic properties of the scene such as albedo, depth, and reflectance properties of the facial surfaces, which were recovered through a shape-from-shading (SfS) algorithm. To extract meaningful patterns from the different maps obtained with the SfS algorithm, we designed a novel shallow CNN architecture for learning features useful to the presentation attack detection (PAD). We performed several experiments considering the intra-and inter-dataset evaluation protocols. The obtained results showed the effectiveness of the proposed method considering several types of photo-and video-based presentation attacks, and in the cross-sensor scenario, besides achieving competitive results for the inter-dataset evaluation protocol. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB Background - It is hypothesised that, despite recent initiatives to improve asthma self-management including asthma education, detailed investigation of the sequence of events culminating in hospital admission will lead to the identification of important management errors and thus the likelihood that the majority of severe asthma attacks are preventable by currently available strategies, and that psychological, health care and socioeconomic factors are risk factors for such management errors. Methods - A cross sectional study was undertaken of 138 patients aged 15-50 years admitted to hospital (general ward or intensive care unit) with acute severe asthma who were assessed within 24-72 hours of admission using a number of previously validated instruments. A detailed history of events of the attack was assessed against predetermined criteria for non or delayed use of oral corticosteroids and non or delayed use of emergency ambulance services. Results - Subjects had evidence of severe chronic asthma and had acute severe asthma at presentation (n = 90, pH = 7.3 (0.2), PACO2 = 7.2 (5.0) kPa) but duration of hospital stay was short (3.7 (2.6) days). Serious management errors occurred very frequently and most were deemed to have been made by the patient. Forward stepwise regression revealed that delayed or non-use of oral corticosteroids was predicted independently by lack of paying job (p = 0.02), high total use of inhaled β agonists in the 24 hours before index admission (p = 0.04), loss of a job in the last year (p = 0.04), low frequency of use of oral corticosteroids in the last year (p = 0.06), concerns during the index attack about medical expenses (p = 0.07), and delay in the use of ambulance services (p = 0.05) - the model being responsible for 23% of the variance. Delayed or non-summoning of emergency ambulance services was predicted independently by total life events (p = 0.03), having something stolen in the last year (p = 0.003), panic during the index attack (p = 0.01), and concerns during the index attack about taking time off work (p = 0.07) - the model being responsible for 21% of the variance. Conclusions - The results of this study show that, despite recent educational advances, serious management errors are common in those admitted to hospital with acute severe asthma and that most management errors relate to patient self- management behaviour. Serious management errors are predicted by a variety of socioeconomic and psychological factors. While the results of this study are consistent with the widely held view that most acute severe attacks are theoretically preventable, the challenge for the future is to change patients' behaviour in the face of considerable adverse socioeconomic and psychological fac

AB The vulnerability of current face recognition systems to presentation attacks significantly limits their application in biometrics. Herein, we present a passive presentation attack detection method based on a complete plenoptic imaging system which can derive the complete plenoptic function of light rays using a single detector. Moreover, we constructed a multi-dimensional face database with 50 subjects and seven different types of presentation attacks. We experimentally demonstrated that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on all types of presentation attacks. © 2013 IEEE.

AB The object face liveness detection for genuine face recognition and user authentication is a difficult task and day to day it becoming an interesting tricky in real time vision and security applications. Since many decades, various authors have proposed new technique and methods and developed but still the system has to improve to recognise the genuine object faces from spoofing objects with increasing in accuracy. However, in account of existing methods were fails in finding of genuine objects from sample objects and individual differences between them. The ordinary classifier cannot simplifies well to various kind of objects in different directions especially in case of blur images. In order to overcome his problem, we proposed an object-specific face authentication system for liveness detection using combined feature descriptors with fuzzy-based SVM classifier, allows to select specific area from whole object, extract features from specific area of object leads reduction in processing time and complexity in feature extraction. Later the system recognise respective faces, finally it checks for live objects with the help of fuzzy logic-based SVM classifier. With these proposed system, makes it practical to train well performed individual object to its certain face with liveness detection and achieved improvement in performance and accuracy.

AB We present the case of a 67-year-old woman who suffered recurrent episodes of angioedema of the face and larynx. After thorough biochemical investigations, an acquired deficiency of C1-INH was suspected. To evaluate a potential underlying malignancy, a whole-body FDG-PET/CT was performed and showed solely a marked splenomegaly pointing towards a splenic marginal zone lymphoma, which was confirmed by pathological examination. With this case, we discuss the pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of recurrent acquired angioedema attacks as the first presentation of an underlying lymphoproliferative disease. © 2020, © Acta Clinica Belgica 2020.

DE Auto-population; Face anti-spoofing; One-class SVM; Planer spoofing; Random scan;
AB Existing architectures used in face anti-spoofing tend to deploy registered spatial measurements to generate feature vectors for spoof detection. This means that the ordering or sequence in which specific statistics are computed cannot be changed, as one moves from one facial profile to another.While this arrangement works in a person-specific setting, it becomes a major drawback when single-sided training is done based on the natural face class alone. To mitigate subject identity linked content interference within the anti-spoofing frame, we propose a identity-independent architecture based on random correlated scans of natural face images. The same natural face image can be scanned multiple times through independent correlated random walks before deriving simple differential features on the 1D scanned vectors.This proposed frame tends to capture the pixel correlation statistics with minimal content interference and shows great promise, particularly when trained on natural face sets, using a one-class support vector machine and cross-validated on other databases. Performance measured in terms of EER for detection of spoof face is found to be 3.8291 % with proposed random scan features, and 2.02 % with auto-population samples for inter database. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB Nowadays, adoption of face recognition for biometric authentication systems is widespread, mainly because this is one of the most accessible biometric characteristic. Techniques intended on deceive these kinds of systems by using a forged biometric sample, such as a printed paper or a recorded video of a genuine access, are known as presentation attacks. Presentation Attack Detection is a crucial step for preventing this kind of unauthorized accesses into restricted areas or devices. In this paper, we propose a new method that relies on a combination of the intrinsic properties of the image with deep neural networks to detect presentation attack attempts. Exploring depth, salience and illumination properties, along with a Convolutional Neural Network, proposed method produce robust and discriminant features which are then classified to detect presentation attacks attempts. In a very challenging cross-dataset scenario, proposed method outperform state-of-the-art methods in two of three evaluated datasets. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB Cloud computing has been playing a significant role in the provisioning of services over the Internet since its birth. However, developers still face several challenges limiting its full potential. The difficulties are mostly due to the large, ever-growing, and ever-changing catalog of services offered by cloud providers. As a consequence, developers must deal with different cloud services in their systems; each managed almost individually and continually growing in complexity. This heterogeneity may limit the view developers have over their system architectures and make the task of managing these resources more complex. This work explores the use of liveness as a way to shorten the feedback loop between developers and their systems in an interactive and immersive way, as they develop and integrate cloud-based systems. The designed approach allows real-time visualization of cloud infrastructures using a visual city metaphor. To assert the viability of this approach, the authors conceived a proof-of-concept and carried on experiments with developers to assess its feasibility. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB With their growing popularity and widespread applications, face recognition systems are attracting more attention from attackers. Thus, face presentation attack detection has emerged as an important research topic in recent years. Existing methods for face presentation attack detection are affected by different cameras and display devices, and their performance is degraded in cross-database testing. In this paper, we propose a face presentation attack detection scheme that fuses multi-perspective dynamic features. One feature is the globally extracted temporal motion pattern of a face in a video. This involves mapping the local and global motion information of the face in the video into a single image. The motion patterns of genuine and fake faces are different, and these patterns are independent of cameras and display devices. Another feature is the visual rhythm of noise patterns, which differs significantly between single and secondary imaging. The proposed scheme fuses these two features at the decision level. Cross-database tests were conducted among the CASIA-FASD, MSU-MFSD and Replay-Attack databases. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2013 IEEE.

AB Biometric methods are of considerable value when used alone or in combination with other identity verification technologies. Two-dimensional facial recognition approaches provide low cost and convenient recognition system due to convenience and ease of use. Rapid face image substitution is one of the main problems in 2D face area. Biometric systems can be attacked by fakes such as images of people’s faces, masks and videos that are easily accessible from social networks. The typical disadvantage of survivability detection in consumer-grade methods is a significant disadvantage and limits the value of device-built biometric authentication in smartphones and tablets. The work is devoted to the study of methods for verifying the belonging of a biometric sample to a living person. The relevance of the work is due to the expansion of the use of biometric authentication systems and the need to protect the biometric identification and authentication processes from hacking attempts using photographs or video. For the experimental evaluation of the complex application of the studied methods, a prototype of a multi-module system for testing faces using neural networks and heuristic algorithms was developed. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB Branches within source code management systems (SCMs) allow a software project to divide work among its teams for concurrent development by isolating changes. However, this benefit comes with several costs: increased time required for changes to move through the system and pain and error potential when integrating changes across branches. In this paper, we present the results of a survey to characterize how developers use branches in a large industrial project and common problems that they face. One of the major problems mentioned was the long delay that it takes changes to move from one team to another, which is often caused by having too many branches (branchmania). To monitor branch health, we introduce a novel what-if analysis to assess alternative branch structures with respect to two properties, isolation and liveness. We demonstrate with several scenarios how our what-if analysis can support branch decisions. By removing high-cost-low-benefit branches in Windows based on our what-if analysis, changes would each have saved 8.9 days of delay and only introduced 0.04 additional conflicts on average. © 2012 ACM.

AB Face anti-spoofing detection gains more and more attention, and due to some attacks like spoofing image, spoofing video and 3D masks etc. in security sensitive area, it has being widely used in industries in China. In this work, we summarize the traditional and recent methods proposed in the area of face anti-spoofing and divide them into three main categories, which are feature based methods, deep learning based methods and other methods. In addition, we also compare the performance of these methods and investigate the application of some famous Chinese enterprises. Finally, we provide an outlook into the future of this field of research. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB The vulnerability of face recognition systems to different presentation attacks has aroused increasing concern in the biometric community. Face presentation detection (PAD) techniques, which aim to distinguish real face samples from spoof artifacts, are the efficient countermeasure. In recent years, various methods have been proposed to address 2D type face presentation attacks, including photo print attack and video replay attack. However, it is difficult to tell which methods perform better for these attacks, especially in practical mobile authentication scenarios, since there is no systematic evaluation or benchmark of the state-of-the-art methods on a common ground (i.e., using the same databases and protocols). Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of several representative face PAD methods (30 in total) on three public mobile spoofing datasets to quantitatively compare the detection performance. Furthermore, the generalization ability of existing methods is tested under cross-database testing scenarios to show the possible database bias. We also summarize meaningful observations and give some insights that will help promote both academic research and practical applications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

DE Fingerprint recognition; Presentation attack detection;
AB Whereas other biometric characteristics, such as the face, are readily available for an eventual attacker through social media or easy to capture with a conventional smartphone, vein patterns can only be acquired with dedicated sensors. This fact makes them relevant not only for recognition purposes but especially for Presentation Attack Detection (PAD), for instance, in combination with fingerprint recognition. In this chapter, we make use of this combination and present a finger vein-based PAD algorithm to detect presentation attacks targeting fingerprint recognition. The experiments are carried out on a newly collected database, comprising 32 species of Presentation Attack Instruments ranging from printed artefacts to more sophisticated fingerprint overlays. The results show that our method preserves a convenient usage while detecting around 90% of the attacks. However, thin and transparent fingerprint overlays remain very challenging. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB Despite the rapid growth of face recognition-based biometrics for both authentication and identification, the security of face biometric systems against presentation attacks (also called spoofing attacks) remains a great concern. Indeed, Face recognition-based authentication techniques can be easily spoofed using various types of attacks such photographs, videos or forged 3D masks. This work proposes a fast and non-intrusive anti-spoofing solution based on Image Quality Assessment (IQA) and motion cues to distinguish between genuine and fake face-appearances. Quality measures are computed following a novel approach which enables us to highlight these liveness-related motion cues, thus outlining the distinction between real faces and spoofing attacks. Moreover, our method is well suited for real-time mobile applications as it takes into consideration both reliable robustness and low complexity of employed algorithms. Our approach is extensively evaluated on three public databases that include different types of presentation attacks. The obtained results proved to outperform state-of-the-art approaches. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB Face liveness detection is a big challenge for the researcher. Face recognition based security system suffer from spoofing attack, because of lacking of proper face liveness detection system. In this paper, we proposed a new approach to prevent spoofing attack with a two stage approach, one is motion based and another is deep learning based. The network is train on ROSE-Youtu Face Liveness Detection Database. The whole model is test on real time videos from webcam. This combine approach gives a better performance than other approaches in ROSE-Youtu Face Liveness Detection Database. Our proposed model gives an accuracy of 95.44% and error rate of 4.56% which is better than existing models on ROSE-Youtu Face Liveness Detection Database. © 2019 IEEE.

AB Face biometry is a popular user authentication scheme that is easy to use and tends to be less invasive than other user authentication approaches. Despite the success achieved by face biometrics, face spoofing attacks (or presentation attacks) still pose a challenge to researchers. In practice, fraudsters may deceive a face authentication system by displaying fake copies of an authorised user face, such as photos or videos, and gain unauthorised access to the system. This work proposes a method for detecting unauthorised access attempts using misrepresentations of the identity of an authorised user. The proposed methodology for presentation attack detection relies on the observation of imaging and liveness attributes, such as the detection of liveness using the face deformation energy, and imaging attributes usually found in authentic accesses such as facial and background textures, and steganalysis features. Based on the experimental results, the proposed approach potentially can detect face spoofing attacks at each frame of video sequences with error rates of half total error rate (HTER)= {6.51, 4.93}%, and also in full video sequences with HTER = {5.55, 0}%, for the CASIA and Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics databases, respectively. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2019.

AB Face recognition has reached a high accuracy in recent years by adopting convolutional neural networks. However, it suffers from presentation attacks such as 2D face photos, and 3D masks. The vulnerability of face recognition and presentation attacks detection (PAD) attract numerous researchers in recent years. Most studies have only focused on PAD algorithms by analyzing texture information, depth information or thermal images. On the other hand, hyperspectral reflectance, which benefits from the development of line-scan HSI sensors, makes it possible to detect information about the inner structure of materials. Our research proposes an auxiliary method to support face recognition by analyzing hyperspectral reflectance. Combined with biological facts of human skin, we trained a neural network with pigmentation fractions inside human skin and corresponding reflectance. The results show high accuracy in identifying skin and non-skin. © 2019 IEEE.

The advance of GPU acceleration techniques and the impact of deep neural networks increase not only the accuracy, but also the popularity of face recognition systems. Although face recognition systems alleviate the problem of person identification, their applications would reveal a new challenging task, that is face spoofing and presentation attacks. No matter in a form of photos, videos, or 3D masks, face spoofing attacks can not only restrict the application of a face recognition system, but also increase its vulnerability in regard of security issues. Consequently, in this paper, a deep neural network scheme for face anti-spoofing and liveness detection is proposed to prevent the existing face recognition systems from common face spoofing attacks. The experimental results have demonstrated the robustness of the proposed method against print, cut, and replay attacks. © 2019 IEEE.

AB The face liveness detection module is one of the most important parts in the state-of-the-art face recognition system. In this paper, we present an efficient method to further improve its accuracy by leveraging multiple feature descriptors. Firstly, a data-driven feature descriptor is proposed based on the Karhunen-Loève Transform (KLT) learned from both client and imposter face images. Moreover, the Completed Local Binary Pattern (CLBP) algorithm is utilized to represent the local structure and the high-middle spectra components of 2D Fourier transform are also utilized to reflect the global structure. These features are fed into the support vector machine (SVM) to learn a classifier for face liveness detection. Experimental results on NUAA illustrate that our proposed method outperforms most of the widely utilized feature descriptors. © 2019 IEEE.

AB In biometrics, face recognition methods are achieving momentum with recent progress in the computer vision(CV). Face recognition is widely used in the identification of an individual's identity. Unfortunately, in recent research work has revealed this face biometrics system is unprotected to spoofing attacks using by very low price instrument such as printed 2D photos attack, 3D masking attack and taking videos using smart devices (reply attack). Therefore, a Liveness Attack Detection (LAD) approach is needed to improve the high-quality security of face recognition system. Most of the earlier worked LAD methods for face anti-spoofing methods have highlight on using the handcrafted features, which are developed by expert knowledge of researcher. As example Gabor filter, Histogram of Oriented Gradients, local ternary pattern, and the Local Binary Pattern. Because of that, the extracted features consider limited factors of the problem, yielding a capture accuracy that is very low and changes with the point of presentation in attack face images. The deep learning method has developed in the computer vision research community, which is proven to be suitable for automatically training. In this article, we approach to mix or combine the handcrafted features and deep neural network features to design the discriminant face spoofing detection. The handcrafted features were based on LBP analysis. We examine the features information from the brightness and the chrominance channels using LBP descriptor. In deep features, we present an approach based on pre-trained convolutional neural network VGG-16 model using static features to recognize video and printed(2D) photo attacks. By attaching this two types of image features on our dataset and public databases, we get good results to identify real and attack images feature, called hybrid features, which has better discrimination ability to understand spoofing image feature. © 2019 IEEE.

AB This paper proposes a single image-based face liveness detection method for discriminating 2-D paper masks from the live faces. Still images taken from live faces and 2-D paper masks were found to bear the differences in terms of shape and detailedness. In order to effectively employ such differences, we exploit frequency and texture information by using power spectrum and Local Binary Pattern (LBP), respectively. In the experiments, three liveness detectors utilizing the power spectrum, LBP, and fusion of the two were trained and tested with two databases which consist of images taken from live and four types of 2-D paper masks. One database was acquired from a web camera while the other was from the camera on the automated teller machine. Experimental results show that the proposed methods can efficiently classify 2-D paper masks and live faces. © 2012 IEEE.

AB Biometric authentication is more and more popular these days. Among authentication techniques, face recognition is the most widely used technique. Face anti-spoofing is the core of the biometric system. Face Anti-spoofing is about prevention of spoofing attack by detecting the face image is live or not before feeding it to the system. In this paper, we propose two streamed line approaches for face anti-spoofing. First approach is detecting of eyes movement and second approach is CNN-based liveness detection by extracting the local features. Experiment demonstrates on comparison of previous works with HTER (Half Total Error Rate) over three datasets: NUAA imposter dataset, Replay Attack and OWN replay dataset which is created in this paper. © 2019 IEEE.

AB Face anti-spoofing detection is critical to guarantee the security of biometric face recognition systems. Despite extensive advances in facial anti-spoofing based on single-model image, little work has been devoted to multi-modal anti-spoofing, which is however widely encountered in real-world scenarios. Following the recent progress, this paper mainly focuses on multi-modal face antispoofing and aims to solve the following two challenges: (1) how to effectively fuse multi-modal information; and (2) how to effectively learn distinguishable features despite single cross-entropy loss. We propose a novel Multi-modal Multi-layer Fusion Convolutional Neural Network (mmfCNN), which targets at finding a discriminative model for recognizing the subtle differences between live and spoof faces. The mmfCNN can fully use different information provided by diverse modalities, which is based on a weight-adaptation aggregation approach. Specifically, we utilize a multi-layer fusion model to further aggregate the features from different layers, which fuses the low-, mid- and high-level information from different modalities in a unified framework. Moreover, a novel Average Binary Center (ABC) loss is proposed to maximize the dissimilarity between the features of live and spoof faces, which helps to stabilize the training to generate a robust and discriminative model. Extensive experiments conducted on the CISIA-SURF and 3DMAD datasets verify the significance and generalization capability of the proposed method for the face anti-spoofing task.

AB Face liveness detection is designed to prevent the face recognition system from using the attacking image as the user's real image. At present, although there are many liveness detection methods, most of the methods have poor generalization ability in practical application. Because these methods are based on datasets, and these data cannot well simulate the data distribution in the real environment. In order to improve the generalization ability of the model, in this paper, we build model using the deep neural network and the dataset collected by ourselves. The experimental results show that our model has achieved significant improvement in the realistic scenario. © 2019 IEEE.

AB Face anti-spoofing is an important task to assure the security of face recognition systems. To be applicable to unconstrained real-world environments, generalization capabilities of the face anti-spoofing methods are required. In this work, we present a face anti-spoofing method with robust generalization ability to unseen environments. To achieve our goal, we suggest bipartite auxiliary supervision to properly guide networks to learn generalizable features. We propose a bipartite auxiliary supervision network (BASN) that comprehensively utilizes the suggested supervision to accurately detect presentation attacks. We evaluate our method by conducting experiments on public benchmark datasets and we achieve state-of-the-art performances. © 2019 IEEE.

AB Face anti-spoofing is very significant for the security of face recognition systems. In this paper, we utilize the near-infrared (NIR) and visible light (VIS) modalities to distinguish the living face from the presentation attacks. We explore different dual-modal combination strategies and propose a dual-modal light-weight network based method for face anti-spoofing. We modify the moblienetv3 and take it as the backbone network to extract the clues from NIR-VIS image pairs. Then we merge and select the feature in the embedding space before the classification. In extensive experiments on self-collected dataset, we demonstrate that the proposed method is efficient, effective and robust. © 2019 IEEE.

AB As our lives get more deeply submerged in digital format, ubiquitous access to sensitive data requires more secure and efficient user authentication procedures. Methods that solely relied on password entry were lately enhanced with the use of biometrics. Yet, these techniques can still be tricked by, for example, recordings of the face, voice, and fingerprint cloning. In this paper we introduce PursuitPass, a compact, robust, and efficient visual pursuit-based authentication system. PursuitPass is a user calibration-free method that requires the user to enter a password by visually pursuing moving targets on a small screen, such as a public ATM or a personal mobile phone. Because eye movements are used as input, passwords are better protected against shoulder surfing. Also, since targets can potentially move in unpredictable ways, it naturally imposes a liveness feature that cannot be counterfeited by recordings of the eyes. We investigated four pattern-matching algorithms to match visual pursuit user data with the movement of the targets. Two experiments were conducted. The first experiment aimed to define the best performing matching algorithm and configuration for PursuitPass. The second experiment aimed to evaluate the performance of our prototype. PursuitPass achieved a 96.82% accuracy with an average time of 10.42 s on a series of 4-digit PIN entry trials. © 2019 IEEE.

TI Liveness detection based on human eye blinking for photo attacks
SO International Journal of Engineering and Advanced Technology
LA English
DT JOUR
DE Eye blinking; Face recognition; Liveness detection; Spoofing attack;
AB Auto face recognition mainly implemented to avoid the replication of identity to demonstrate through security check. This rage of face verification has brought intensive interest about facial biometric towards attacks of spoofing, in which a person’s mask or photo can be produced to be authorized. So, we propose a liveness detection based on eye blinking, where eyes are extracted from human face. The method of face recognition was applied by utilizing OpenCV classifier and dlib library, and a concept of edge detection and calculation of structure to extract the portion of the eye and to observe and make note of variation in the attributes of the eyes over a time period was employed. The landmarks are plotted accurately enough to derive the state of eye if it is closed or opened. A scalar quantity EAR (eye aspect ratio) is derived from landmark positions defined by the algorithm to identify a blink corresponding to every frame. The set of EAR values of successive frames are detected as a eye blink by a OpenCV classifier displayed on a small window when person is in front of camera. Finally, it gives the accuracy result whether it is human being or spoof attack. ©BEIESP.

AB Gaming services, including EduTech services, do not use strong user identification and authentication practically. The most serious barrier in terms of information security is biometrics. The problem of replacing the biometric identifier taken from a smartphone or mobile computer camera is considered in the article. Solution of this problem for gaming services is based on the hybrid method called liveness detection. The article describes the requirements and experimental values for enhanced identification. The architecture and parameters of a convolutional neural network that implements the recognition of an additional feature are also shown. The order and results of testing the enhanced identification module are given. The developed identification module has the an additional feature recognition accuracy up to 100% in situation that user's head is turned up to 30°, and up to 70% when the user's head is turned up to 45°. The FAR value of this system was 1%. The FRR value was 0%. The module does not use additional hardware and can be used on a smartphone or mobile computer without upgrading the latter. Attack with the substitution of a biometric feature supplied from the camera is much more difficult to be realized if suggested solution is implemented. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB In this paper, a face liveness detection benchmark is established and maintained, wherein 400 images pairs captured with binocular camera are made openly available for research purposes. This image dataset contains numbers of people with varied expressions, illumination, and background environment conditions, etc., among which 200 image pairs characterize lively human faces, and the other half are planar face pictures. The benchmark provides a platform for researchers to test stereo matching algorithms for liveness detection, where the detection performance is evaluated via a binary classification on the detection response for being a lively human or not. The feasibility of SIFT features are verified based on a comparative analysis of the classification result, and a set of optimal parameters for the classification is given which provides a reference for further research. * denotes the equal contributions. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB Face recognition, which is security-critical, has been widely deployed in our daily life. However, traditional face recognition technologies in practice can be spoofed easily, for example, by using a simple printed photo. In this paper, we propose a novel face liveness detection approach to counter spoofing attacks by recovering sparse 3D facial structure. Given a face video or several images captured from more than two viewpoints, we detect facial landmarks and select key frames. Then, the sparse 3D facial structure can be recoveredfrom the selected key frames. Finally, an Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained to distinguish the genuine and fake faces. Compared with the previous works, the proposed method has the following advantages. First, it gives perfect liveness detection results, which meets the security requirement of face biometric systems. Second, it is independent on cameras or systems, which works well on different devices. Experiments with genuine faces versus planar photo faces and warped photo faces demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art liveness detection methods. © 2013 IEEE.

AB Presentation attacks can provide unauthorized access to the users and fool face recognition systems for both small scale and large scale applications. Among all the presentation attacks, 2D print and replay attacks are very popular due to their ease and cost-effectiveness in attacking face recognition systems. However, over the years, there are several successful presentation attack detection algorithms developed to detect 2D print and replay attacks. Generally, 2D presentation attacks are detected using the presence or absence of micro patterns which distinguish a real input from an attacked input. However, if a smart attacker digitally 'pre-processes' the image using intensity transforms and then performs 2D presentation attack, differences between real and attacked samples due to the micro-patterns would be minimized. In this paper, for the first time, we show that simple intensity transforms such as Gamma correction, log transform, and brightness control can help an attacker to deceive face presentation attack detection algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that the smart attacker can increase the error rate of the hand-crafted as well as deep learning based presentation attack detectors. © 2019 IEEE.

AB In applications of cyberspace security, face liveness detection is significant for face recognition systems. In this paper, an innovative face anti-spoofing algorithm against video-based face spoofing attacks is proposed based on local binary patterns and multilayer discrete cosine transform (LBP-MDCT) and convolutional neural network (CNN). First, we first extract face images from a target video, generate LBP features for each extracted face image and perform multilayer DCT onto the features to obtain LBP-MDCT features. Second, we input part of face images into CNN to obtain CNN features. After that, the two types of features are respectively input into support vector machine (SVM) classifier. In the last stage, the SVM output is fused with a decision-level operation to determine whether the target video is a spoof attack or a valid access. Compared with existing algorithms, the experimental results on two benchmarking datasets (Replay-Attack dataset and CASIAFASD dataset) demonstrate the excellent effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2019, Editorial Office of Journal of Applied Sciences.

AB To create security frameworks, numerous biometric frameworks are proposed to protect a spoof attack. Face recognition (FR) is one of the most broadly utilized innovations. One of the principle issues of utilizing FR is that the frameworks can easily get attacked by spoof faces. To avoid these attacks by spoof faces and to improve the accuracy of FR frameworks, numerous anti spoofing techniques are available. A protected system needs Liveness Detection in order to shield against such spoofing. The paper proposes liveness detection to identify the spoofing attack. The implemented system basically depends on some statistical face feature along with KNN classifier to identify fake faces. The system shows improved accuracy compared with algorithms in the literature. © 2019 IJSTR.

AB Recently facial recognition Technology are being habitual for various access control requirements and spoof detection in such a system has drawn growing attention. In this paper, we represent by comparison analysis of different local descriptors and off the shelf deep networks for feature extraction- Local Binary Pattern (LBP), SIFT, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Shallow CNN, VGG16 and Inception-Resnet-V2 for face spoofing detection. Furthermore, we evaluated three Classifiers-Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) over the feature extracted through local descriptors and deep networks. The evaluation has been conducted using publicly available YALE face database containing real and fake facial images. Real dataset consists of 5121 entries and fake dataset has 7508 images. The analysis results demonstrate that the best prediction accuracy of real and spoof is obtained with Inception_ResnetV2 features when classified with ANN and about 96.23% accuracy is achieved. © BEIESP.

AB Face authentication is vulnerable to media-based virtual face forgery (MVFF) where adversaries display photos/videos or 3D virtual face models of victims to spoof face authentication systems. In this paper, we propose a liveness detection mechanism, called FaceCloseup, to protect the face authentication on mobile devices. FaceCloseup detects MVFF-based attacks by analyzing the distortion of face regions in a user's closeup facial videos captured by built-in camera on mobile device. It can detect MVFF-based attacks with an accuracy of 99.48%. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB In this paper, we proposed a three-dimensional face recognition method based on liveness detection. Firstly, one liveness detection method based on the three-dimensional structure of the face was proposed. According to the face feature point localization algorithm combined with the RANSAC fitting algorithm and the SVM model training prediction method, the depth information was used to judge the reality of the face, and the detection of the photo and video attacker behavior were solved. In this paper, the traditional loss function and the new central loss function were used as the supervised signals in the face recognition process. We used model fine-tuning to train two independent convolutional neural networks, and then we used the score fusion approach to fuse facial feature matching. Finally, we evaluated the Eurecom and Vap public test sets based on the way of actual application. The experimental results showed that compared with the traditional in liveness detection, our algorithm made use of the advantages of three-dimensional information to realize the judgment of face reality, and the algorithm had better accuracy in three-dimensional face recognition section. © 2019 IEEE.

AB Face anti-spoofing is an important topic of face recognition system to protect against security breach. Previous approach for face spoofing detection based on distortion in images have achieved promising results. However, their generalization ability has not been sufficiently addressed. In this work, we propose a face spoofing detection based on color distortion analysis, which captures the chromatic aberration from a face image. Color distortion analysis extracts color moment and ranked histogram features, which generate 116 feature vector. The feature vector then forwarded to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to perform dimensionality reduction. For classifying a live or spoof face image, a Naïve Bayes classifier performed on the principal components obtained from PCA. From experiment, the proposed method achieves competitive performance compared to previous approach, with the highest TPR (True Positive Rate) is 97.4%. © 2019 IEEE.

AB Biometric system is widely used to recognize the authorized person based on either behavioural characteristics or physical. But this can be spoofed using various traits. Spoofing attack is nothing but attacking or harming biometric recognition system using security features to use system without permission of authorized user. Images or video of person can be easily available from social media or can be easily captured from some distance. Consider what would happen if a nefarious user tried to purposely circumvent your face recognition system. Such a user could try to hold up a photo of another person. Maybe they even have a photo or video on their smart phone that they could hold up to the camera responsible for performing face recognition.In the project, we have tried spotting these “fake” versus “real/legitimate” faces and how we could apply anti-face spoofing algorithms into our facial recognition applications by applying live ness detection[1] with Open CV. © Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering & Sciences Publication.

AB Face anti-spoofing detection is a crucial procedure in biometric face recognition systems. State-of-the-art approaches, based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), present good results in this field. However, previous works focus on one single modal data with limited number of subjects. The recently published CASIA-SURF dataset is the largest dataset that consists of 1000 subjects and 21000 video clips with 3 modalities (RGB, Depth and IR). In this paper, we propose a multi-stream CNN architecture called FaceBagNet to make full use of this data. The input of FaceBagNet is patch-level images which contributes to extract spoof-specific discriminative information. In addition, in order to prevent overfitting and for better learning the fusion features, we design a Modal Feature Erasing (MFE) operation on the multi-modal features which erases features from one randomly selected modality during training. As the result, our approach wins the second place in CVPR 2019 ChaLearn Face Anti-spoofing attack detection challenge. Our final submission gets the score of 99.8052% (TPR@FPR = 10e-4) on the test set. © 2019 IEEE.

AB Personal identity verification based on biometrics has received increasing attention since it allows reliable authentication through intrinsic characteristics, such as face, voice, iris, fingerprint, and gait. Particularly, face recognition techniques have been used in a number of applications, such as security surveillance, access control, crime solving, law enforcement, among others. To strengthen the results of verification, biometric systems must be robust against spoofing attempts with photographs or videos, which are two common ways of bypassing a face recognition system. In this paper, we describe an anti-spoofing solution based on a set of low-level feature descriptors capable of distinguishing between live and spoof images and videos. The proposed method explores both spatial and temporal information to learn distinctive characteristics between the two classes. Experiments conducted to validate our solution with datasets containing images and videos show results comparable to state-of-the-art approaches. © 2011 IEEE.

AB Face recognition has achieved unprecedented results, surpassing human capabilities in certain scenarios. However, these automatic solutions are not ready for production because they can be easily fooled by simple identity impersonation attacks. And although much effort has been devoted to develop face anti-spoofing models, their generalization capacity still remains a challenge in real scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that reformulates the Generalized Presentation Attack Detection (GPAD) problem from an anomaly detection perspective. Technically, a deep metric learning model is proposed, where a triplet focal loss is used as a regularization for a novel loss coined 'metric-softmax', which is in charge of guiding the learning process towards more discriminative feature representations in an embedding space. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of our deep anomaly detection architecture, by introducing a few-shot a posteriori probability estimation that does not need any classifier to be trained on the learned features. We conduct extensive experiments using the GRAD-GPAD framework that provides the largest aggregated dataset for face GPAD. Results confirm that our approach is able to outperform all the state-of-the-art methods by a considerable margin. © 2019 IEEE.

AB Face presentation attack detection (PAD) has drawn increasing attentions to secure face recognition (FR) systems which are being widely used in many applications from access control to smartphone unlock. Traditional approaches for PAD may lack good generalization capability into new application scenarios due to the limited number of subjects and data modality. In this work, we propose an end-to-end multi-modal fusion approach via spatial and channel attention to improve PAD performance on CASIA-SURF. Specifically, We first build four branches integrated with spatial and channel attention module to obtain the uniform features of different modalities, i.e., RGB, Depth, IR and the fused modality with 9 channels which concatenating three modalities. Subsequently, the features extracted from the four branches are concatenated and fed into the shared layers to learn more discriminative features from the fusion perspective. Finally, we get the classification confidence scores w.r.t. PAD or not. The entire network is optimized with the joint of the center loss and softmax loss and SGRD solver to update the parameters. The proposed approach shows promising results on the CASIA-SURF dataset. © 2019 IEEE.

AB Face anti-spoofing is crucial for the security of face recognition systems. Learning based methods especially deep learning based methods need large-scale training samples to reduce overfitting. However, acquiring spoof data is very expensive since the live faces should be reprinted and re-captured in many views. In this paper, we present a method to synthesize virtual spoof data in 3D space to alleviate this problem. Specifically, we consider a printed photo as a flat surface and mesh it into a 3D object, which is then randomly bent and rotated in 3D space. Afterward, the transformed 3D photo is rendered through perspective projection as a virtual sample. The synthetic virtual samples can significantly boost the anti-spoofing performance when combined with a proposed data balancing strategy. Our promising results open up new possibilities for advancing face anti-spoofing using cheap and large-scale synthetic data. © 2019 IEEE.

AB Face spoofing attacks have received significant attention because of criminals who are developing different techniques such as warped photos, cut photos, 3D masks, etc. to easily fool the face recognition systems. In order to improve the security measures of biometric systems, deep learning models offer powerful solutions; but to attain the benefits of multilayer features remains a significant challenge. To alleviate this limitation, this paper presents a hybrid framework to build the feature representation by fusing ResNet with more discriminative power. First, two variants of the residual learning framework are selected as deep feature extractors to extract informative features. Second, the fullyconnected layers are used as separated feature descriptors. Third, PCA based Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is proposed as a feature fusion strategy to combine relevant information and to improve the features' discrimination capacity. Finally, the support vector machine (SVM) is used to construct the final representation of facial features. Experimental results show that our proposed framework achieves a state-of-the-art performance without finetuning, data augmentation or coding strategy on benchmark databases, namely the MSU mobile face spoof database and the CASIA face anti-spoofing database. © 2019 IEEE.

AB With the advancements in technology and growing popularity of facial photo editing in the social media landscape, tools such as face swapping and face morphing have become increasingly accessible to the general public. It opens up the possibilities for different kinds of face presentation attacks, which can be taken advantage of by impostors to gain unauthorized access of a biometric system. Moreover, the wide availability of 3D printers has caused a shift from print attacks to 3D mask attacks. With increasing types of attacks, it is necessary to come up with a generic and ubiquitous algorithm with a panoptic view of these attacks, and can detect a spoofed image irrespective of the method used. The key contribution of this paper is designing a deep learning based panoptic algorithm for detection of both digital and physical presentation attacks using Cross Asymmetric Loss Function (CALF). The performance is evaluated for digital and physical attacks in three scenarios: ubiquitous environment, individual databases, and cross-attack/cross-database. Experimental results showcase the superior performance of the proposed presentation attack detection algorithm. © 2019 IEEE.

AB While the performance of face recognition systems has improved significantly in the last decade, they are proved to be highly vulnerable to presentation attacks (spoofing). Most of the research in the field of face presentation attack detection (PAD), was focused on boosting the performance of the systems within a single database. Face PAD datasets are usually captured with RGB cameras, and have very limited number of both bona-fide samples and presentation attack instruments. Training face PAD systems on such data leads to poor performance, even in the closed-set scenario, especially when sophisticated attacks are involved. We explore two paths to boost the performance of the face PAD system against challenging attacks. First, by using multichannel (RGB, Depth and NIR) data, which is still easily accessible in a number of mass production devices. Second, we develop a novel Autoencoders + MLP based face PAD algorithm. Moreover, instead of collecting more data for training of the proposed deep architecture, the domain adaptation technique is proposed, transferring the knowledge of facial appearance from RGB to multi-channel domain. We also demonstrate, that learning the features of individual facial regions, is more discriminative than the features learned from an entire face. The proposed system is tested on a very recent publicly available multi-channel PAD database with a wide variety of presentation attacks. © 2019 IEEE.

AB We have evaluated face recognition software to be used with hand held devices (smartphones). While we can not go into specifics of the systems under test (due to NDAs), we can present the results of our evaluation of liveness detection (or presentation attack detection), matching performance, and success with different complexity levels of attacks. We will contrast the robustness against presentation attacks with the systems usability during regular use, and highlight where currently state of commercial of the shelf systems (COTS) stand in that regard. We will look at the results specifically under the tradeoff between acceptance, linked with usability, and security, which usually negatively impacts usability. © 2019 IEEE.

AB One-class spoofing detection approaches have been an effective alternative to the two-class learners in the face presentation attack detection particularly in unseen attack scenarios. We propose an ensemble based anomaly detection approach applicable to one-class classifiers. A new score normalisation method is proposed to normalise the output of individual outlier detectors before fusion. To comply with the accuracy and diversity objectives for the component classifiers, three different strategies are utilised to build a pool of anomaly experts. To boost the performance, we also make use of the client-specific information both in the design of individual experts as well as in setting a distinct threshold for each client. We carry out extensive experiments on three face anti-spoofing datasets and show that the proposed ensemble approaches are comparable superior to the techniques based on the two-class formulation or class-independent settings. © 2019 IEEE.

AB Face recognition systems are vulnerable to presentation attacks such as replay and 3D masks. In the literature, several presentation attack detection (PAD) algorithms are developed to address this problem. However, for the first time in the literature, this paper showcases that it is possible to "fool" the PAD algorithms using adversarial perturbations. The proposed perturbation approach attacks the presentation attack detection algorithms at the PAD feature level via transformation of features from one class (attack class) to another (real class). The PAD feature tampering network utilizes convolutional autoencoder to learn the perturbations. The proposed algorithm is evaluated with respect to CNN and local binary pattern (LBP) based PAD algorithms. Experiments on three databases, Replay, SMAD, and Face Morph, showcase that the proposed approach increases the equal error rate of PAD algorithms by at least two times. For instance, on the SMAD database, PAD equal error rate (EER) of 20.1% is increased to 55.7% after attacking the PAD algorithm. © 2019 IEEE.

AB Facial recognition has been employed as a user-friendly person authentication method, and facial spoofing attack has become a common problem. Although there are two kinds of facial spoofing attacks, 2D spoofing and 3D spoofing, almost studies evaluate the performance only for 2D spoofing. Temporal change of face color will be a possible characteristic to detect liveness against to 3D spoofing attack because there is a relationship between the skin blood perfusion change and the temporal color change in facial video images. This paper proposes two features, R-G correlation feature and interarea correlation feature, to detect liveness using video images. Also, liveness detection method using support vector machine is demonstrated. The performance was evaluated by accuracy (ACC) for classifying liveness face and three types of spoofing face—2D printed image, 2D monitor image, and 3D doll. The ACC was 99.2% at the lighting condition of room light, 99.5% at sunlight illuminating the face, and 98.6% at sunlight illuminating the back of the head. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Aim: To evaluate the factors associated with lack of awareness of glaucoma and late presentation to the doctor in Singapore Chinese patients with acute angle closure (AAC) Methods: A prospective, hospital based case series of 105 patients aged 35 years and above who presented with a first attack of AAC in a tertiary hospital in Singapore was conducted. A research assistant interviewed all patients face to face in clinic and recorded demographic factors, awareness of glaucoma, and subjective barriers to seeing a doctor. The time from onset of symptoms to presentation at the clinic was noted. Results: Overall, 22.9% of patients had heard of glaucoma. The multivariate adjusted odds ratio (OR) of unawareness of glaucoma in older people (> 60 years) was 1.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.5 to 4.6), 3.2 (95% CI 1.1 to 9.2) for adults who were not working, and 13.8 (95% CI 1.3 to 146.7) for patients who had less than a pre-university education. A significant proportion (31.7%) of patients presented to the doctor 24 hours or more after symptoms occurred. In a multiple logistic regression model, the adjusted OR of late presentation was 8.5 (95% CI 1.04 to 69.5) if there was no car access, 5.0 (95% CI 1.0 to 24.6) if the patients spoke Chinese, and 3.3 (95% CI 0.9 to 11.9) if there was nobody to accompany to hospital. Conclusion: Glaucoma awareness among patients suffering AAC was not high. Lack of awareness was associated with increasing age, lack of formal education, and unemployment. A significant proportion of patients seek medical attention late. Risk factors for late presentation include lack of car access, nobody to accompany the patient, and speaking the Chinese language primarily. Health education programmes may help increase the knowledge and awareness of glaucoma.

AB Face anti-spoofing plays a vital role in security systems including face payment systems and face recognition systems. Previous studies showed that live faces and presentation attacks have significant differences in both remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) and texture information, we propose a generalized method exploiting both rPPG and texture features for face anti-spoofing task. First, multi-scale long-term statistical spectral (MS-LTSS) features with variant granularities are designed for representation of rPPG information. Second, a contextual patch-based convolutional neural network (CP-CNN) is used for extracting global-local and multi-level deep texture features simultaneously. Finally, weight summation strategy is employed for decision level fusion, which helps to generalize the method for not only print attack and replay attack but also mask attack. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on five databases, namely 3DMAD, HKBU-Mars V1, MSU-MFSD, CASIA-FASD, and OULU-NPU, to show the superior results of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art methods. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB Iris-based identification methods have been popularly used in real-world applications due to the unique characteristics of iris when compared to other biometric characteristics like face and fingerprint. As technological advances and low-cost artefacts are becoming more available, vulnerabilities to iris biometrics due to presentation attacks (PAs) are becoming a challenging problem. Presentation attack detection (PAD) algorithms have been employed in biometric capture devices and it has been an active research topic in the past years. In this study, a detailed survey and evaluation of state-of-the-art texture-based iris PAD methods are performed. Five different PAD methods are tested on four different datasets consisting of print and contact lens presentation attacks. Extensive experiments are performed on four different scenarios of presentation attack and results are presented. The properties of PAD algorithms like the quality of the database, the generalization abilities are mainly discussed in this work. It has been observed that fusion-based PAD methods perform better than other methods. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB Today, face biometric systems are becoming widely accepted as a standard method for identity authentication in many security settings. For example, their deployment in automated border control gates plays a crucial role in accurate document authentication and reduced traveler flow rates in congested border zones. The proliferation of such systems is further spurred by the advent of portable devices. On the one hand, modern smartphone and tablet cameras have in-built user authentication applications while on the other hand, their displays are being consistently exploited for face spoofing. Similar to biometric systems of other physiological biometric identifiers, face biometric systems have their own unique set of potential vulnerabilities. In this work, these vulnerabilities (presentation attacks) are being explored via a biologically-inspired presentation attack detection model which is termed “BIOPAD.” Our model employs Gabor features in a feedforward hierarchical structure of layers that progressively process and train from visual information of people's faces, along with their presentation attacks, in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions. BIOPAD's performance is directly compared with other popular biologically-inspired layered models such as the “Hierarchical Model And X” (HMAX) that applies similar handcrafted features, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that discover low-level features through stochastic descent training. BIOPAD shows superior performance to both HMAX and CNN in all of the three presentation attack databases examined and these results were consistent in two different classifiers (Support Vector Machine and k-nearest neighbor). In certain cases, our findings have shown that BIOPAD can produce authentication rates with 99% accuracy. Finally, we further introduce a new presentation attack database with visible and near-infrared information for direct comparisons. Overall, BIOPAD's operation, which is to fuse information from different spectral bands at both feature and score levels for the purpose of face presentation attack detection, has never been attempted before with a biologically-inspired algorithm. Obtained detection rates are promising and confirm that near-infrared visual information significantly assists in overcoming presentation attacks. © 2019 Tsitiridis, Conde, Gomez Ayllon and Cabello.

AB The continuously increasing number of attacks on authentication systems occur due to the dependency on weak security mechanisms and approaches, so live biometric systems should be utilized. Especially since they are an approved base of trustworthy authentication. Password based authentication systems offer numerous benefits and they are common in application. However, they need to be memorized and are a prey to dictionary, password guessing, and password resetting attacks by the attackers. Biometric based authentication mechanisms prove an alternative; as they do not need a user to memorize and are difficult to duplicate since they need physical presence of the end users. But due to the constant increase of number of attacks, an attacker has the capability to deceive the system by proving fake or previously recorded biometric features. Liveness detection while acquiring biometric authentication enables setting a limit to the attacks occurring. It is an innovative method that will be constantly authenticating and monitoring the subject user after a specific duration of time to validate the user identity. The performance of this mechanism is intended to be a trustworthy solution for this issue. In this paper, various facial recognition schemes that are used to improve effectiveness of resulting authentication systems will be reviewed. © 2019 IEEE.

AB Identity authentication based on face recognition has been significantly improved due to the outstanding ability of face detection, thus it plays an important role in society. However, face recognition system might be deceived by malicious face spoof attacks raising risk from both safety and property. The algorithm to accurately detect face anti-spoofing in identity authentication system is becoming crucial. In this paper, a shallow convolutional neural network with laplacian embedding (shallowCNN-LE) is proposed for face anti-spoofing. Two different types of features are concatenated to accurately detect the face liveness, including depth features and dynamic texture features. First, the developed shallow CNN model contains four layers which make the model faster. Second, we integrate dynamic texture features extracted by using the dual tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) with the depth features as input features to feed into the proposed model. Finally, we propose a laplacian embedding algorithm, which can maintain the inter-class discrimination and penalize the distance of intra-class. When embedding the laplacian loss with the softmax loss, the proposed method can obtain much more discriminative features, which is helpful to detect face anti-spoofing. Experimental results on public databases of CASIA FASD, Replay attack and MSU USSA database demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for face anti-spoofing detection. © 2019 IEEE.

AB With the wide spread of face recognition systems (FRSs) in our daily life, the security problem of FRSs, particularly presentation attack (PA) with printed photos or recorded videos, is becoming more and more serious. Inspired by the finding of prior studies that different regions on faces seem to have different contributions to the detection of PA, in this paper, we propose an attention based method which can learn to find spatial regions containing more useful information for detecting PA and meanwhile suppress less useful ones. In order to further improve the performance, we introduce exclusivity regularization to reduce the redundancy between different attention maps, and employ ranking loss to better fuse the classification results on the obtained multiple attention maps. The proposed network can be trained effectively in an end-to-end manner. Intra-evaluation experiments on Oulu-NPU dataset and cross-testing experiments between CASIA-MFSD and Replay-Attack show that the proposed method achieves competitive results compared with the state-of-the-art. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB The importance of iron play to scoring in golf is widely recognised. To better understand this relationship, accurate, yet unobtrusive measurement techniques are required to capture information about the collision between the golf club and ball. This article presents a method for tracking an iron clubhead prior to impact with the ball. Using repeated shots by a golf robot with a 5-iron and 9-iron, the system reliably measured clubhead speed (standard deviation ≤ 0.5 mile/h), face angle (≤0.2°), club path (≤0.2°), effective loft (≤0.5°), attack angle (≤0.1°) and effective lie (≤0.3°). Impact position was within a standard deviation ≤ 0.6 mm for repeated shots. Absolute accuracy of horizontal impact position at initial contact was <1 mm, whereas a systematic offset of up to 4 mm was found for vertical impact position compared to tests using impact location tape. This offset was dependent on the loft of the club and could be explained by the interaction between ball and club during contact. In addition, a unique feature of the algorithm is presented which categorises impacts commonly known as ‘top’, ‘thin’, ‘good’ or ‘heavy’ shots, which is facilitated through tracking of the bottom edge of the clubhead using virtual markers. Hence, this tracking system is presented as a novel solution to accurately measure clubhead presentation and initial ball impact location for irons. © IMechE 2018.

AB Biometrics systems have replaced traditional ways of authenticating systems. The concept of face recognition based on the fact that every person has different biological attributes. Yet, these systems have a possibility to suffer from the various types of spoofing attacks. Spoofing is the process of fooling the system by impersonating a legitimate user to gain illegal access. Face verification systems are the easiest ones to suffer from spoof attack because facial pictures are easy to access. Spoofing attack can be classified into two types: 2D and 3D. 2D attacks faked by using the photos or video of the legitimate user and 3D attacks faked by using 3D masks. Here, We have introduced a new approach to detect presence of 3D mask based face anti-spoofing using frequency and texture based feature descriptors. The proposed approach extracts Local Binary Pattern based texture features from discrete wavelet transformed images. We have evaluated the proposed approach on the 3D Mask Attack dataset that is available publicly. Our approach is performed better than state of art. © 2018 IEEE.

AB The vulnerabilities of face-based biometric systems to presentation attacks have been finally recognized but yet we lack generalized software-based face presentation attack detection (PAD) methods performing robustly in practical mobile authentication scenarios. This is mainly due to the fact that the existing public face PAD datasets are beginning to cover a variety of attack scenarios and acquisition conditions but their standard evaluation protocols do not encourage researchers to assess the generalization capabilities of their methods across these variations. In this present work, we introduce a new public face PAD database, OULU-NPU, aiming at evaluating the generalization of PAD methods in more realistic mobile authentication scenarios across three covariates: unknown environmental conditions (namely illumination and background scene), acquisition devices and presentation attack instruments (PAI). This publicly available database consists of 5940 videos corresponding to 55 subjects recorded in three different environments using high-resolution frontal cameras of six different smartphones. The high-quality print and videoreplay attacks were created using two different printers and two different display devices. Each of the four unambiguously defined evaluation protocols introduces at least one previously unseen condition to the test set, which enables a fair comparison on the generalization capabilities between new and existing approaches. The baseline results using color texture analysis based face PAD method demonstrate the challenging nature of the database. © 2017 IEEE.

DE Dynamic Texture Feature; Face Liveness Detection; Local Texture Feature; Spatial-Temporal Texture Casca;
AB To solve the security problem in identity authentication, the face liveness detection method is always employed. Therefore, a spatial-temporal texture cascaded feature method is proposed to improve the robustness of living face detection. Firstly, local binary pattern(LBP) is utilized to calculate the differential excitation of Weber local descriptor(WLD), and Prewitt operator is exploited to calculate the directional angle of WLD to extract texture features in time domain and space domain. Secondly, the histogram of texture features obtained from three orthogonal space-time planes, XY, XT and YT, is cascaded. Finally, the dynamic texture features, namely spatial-temporal texture cascade features, can be used to determine whether the real face or the disguised face. Experimental results on CASIA face anti-spoofing database and replay-attack database show that the proposed method obtains higher recognition rate than the existing mainstream local texture feature methods and it can be widely used in identity authentication and security monitoring systems. © 2019, Science Press.

AB Hypnosis increases the effectiveness of anxiety treatment in psychotherapy. Evidence shows that hypnosis is effective for treating performance anxiety, social anxiety, panic attacks and generalized anxiety. More specifically, in children, it is a gentle method of intervention that makes use of the natural abilities of the child such as curiosity, imagination and play. It can also contribute to improving the quality of life of anxious children, as well as their self-esteem, by inviting them to develop strategies of emotional self-control and adaptation to the social situations they face. The Ericksonian strategic hypnosis approach, based on therapeutic metaphorical stories, highlights the child's natural motivations and focuses on positive emotions. Finally, it offers a good treatment potential to therapists mastering the communicational subtlety of these techniques. In this presentation, we will explore this avenue with clinical vignettes and a short exercise for the participants. © 2019 A.N.A.E.

AB Objective: Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) related to a brainstem cavernous malformation (CM) is a rare entity. We present the first radiosurgical management of a patient with TN secondary to a CM. Clinical Presentation: An 80-year-old female presented with a 33-year history of progressively severe TN refractory to medications. Imaging confirmed a solitary CM located at the pontine dorsal root entry zone of cranial nerve 5. Treatment: Stereotactic radiosurgery of the trigeminal nerve was performed using the Leksell gamma knife. A single 4-mm isocenter of radiation was focused on the trigeminal nerve and a maximum dose of 80 Gy (40 Gy at the 50% isodose line) was delivered to the nerve. Results: At 1 year, the patient noted that the severe pain attacks had been reduced by 75%, although a background lingering discomfort persisted. Pain suppression medications had been significantly reduced to lamotrigine 100 mg twice daily. Her preoperative distribution of sensory dysfunction mildly increased. Conclusion: For medically refractory TN related to a CM, radiosurgery of the afferent nerve may ameliorate pain without a major decrease in sensation. The more than 30-year history of pain in our patient may have reduced the chance of more significant pain relief. © 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB Modern face recognition systems are accurate but they are vulnerable to different types of spoofing attacks. To solve this problem, conventional face authentication systems typically employ an additional module to analyze the liveness of the input faces before feeding it into the face recognition module. Such two-stage designs not only suffer from longer processing time but also require more storage and resources, which are usually limited on mobile and embedded platforms. In this paper, we propose a multi-task Convolutional Neural Network(CNN), namely LiveFace, for face-authentication. Given an input face image, LiveFace generates two outputs through a single stage: (i) a face representation that can be used for identification or verification, and (ii) the corresponding liveness score. The two tasks share lower layers to reduce the computation cost. Experimental results using three datasets show that our model achieves a comparable performance on both face recognition and anti-spoofing tasks but much faster than conventional authentication systems. In addition, we have implemented a prototype of our scheme on Android phones and demonstrated that our scheme can run in real-time on three Android devices that we have tested. © 2018 IEEE.

AB In the context of face recognition systems, liveness test is a binary classification task aiming at distinguishing between input images that come from real people's faces and input images that come from photos or videos of those faces, and presented to the system's camera by an attacker. In this paper, we train the state-of-the-art, general purpose deep neural network ResNet for liveness testing, and measure the effect on its performance of adversarial attacks based on the manipulation of the saturation component of the imposter images. Our findings suggest that higher saturation values in the imposter images lead to a decrease in the network's performance. Next, we study the relationship between the proposed adversarial attacks and corresponding direct presentation attacks. Initial results on a small dataset of processed images which are then printed on paper or displayed on an LCD or a mobile phone screen, show that higher saturation values lead to higher values in the network's loss function, indicating that these colour manipulation techniques can indeed be converted into enhanced presentation attacks. © 2019 The Author(s) Eurographics Proceedings © 2019 The Eurographics Association.

TI Face liveness detection based on client identity using siamese network

AB Face liveness detection is an essential prerequisite for face recognition applications. Previous face liveness detection methods usually train a binary classifier to differentiate between a fake face and a real face before face recognition. The client identity information is not utilized in previous face liveness detection methods. However, in practical face recognition applications, face spoofing attacks are always aimed at a specific client, and the client identity information can provide useful clues for face liveness detection. In this paper, we propose a face liveness detection method based on the client identity using Siamese network. We detect face liveness after face recognition instead of before face recognition, that is, we detect face liveness with the client identity information. We train a Siamese network with image pairs. Each image pair consists of two real face images or one real and one fake face images. The face images in each pair come from a same client. Given a test face image, the face image is firstly recognized by face recognition system, then the real face image of the identified client is retrieved to help the face liveness detection. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

DE Biometric technologies; face recognition; laboratories; masks; spoofing;
AB Spoofing denotes attempts to cheat biometric technologies with artefacts (e.g. fake fingers, masks). This way of circumventing biometric systems has recently generated great interest in the line of work known as ‘anti-spoofing’, which is responsible for developing counter measures. Part of the work of biometric laboratories revolves around identifying imaginable spoofs and spoofers and developing technologies that can detect real from fake bodies. Based on fieldwork among researchers in a biometric lab and at at international conferences where policy-makers, security officials and industry discuss biometric technologies, the article shows how the figure of the spoofer epitomizes certain concerns and brings with it particular types of practices and threat scenarios. Biometric technologies, it is argued, are constantly changing shape in response to the imagined, potential threats embodied by the spoofer in, for example, state security contexts and at borders, where fears of the potential consequences of uncontrolled migration, terrorism and global crime prevail. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB As the internet evolved from a network of routers, telecommunication companies became providers of our global infrastructure backbone. They also became the number one target of cybersecurity attacks, attracting double the annual Distributed Denial of Service (DdoS) attacks of the number two target, financial institutions. The author leverages two decades of experience working with telecommunications infrastructure across the European Union and Asia-Pacific regions, to reflect upon the circumstances in which cybersecurity breaches have penetrated core telecommunications infrastructure and the counter-measures Telcos have taken to counter them. This qualitative research forms the basis of a presentation of “insider insights” from the Telco industry made applicable to space. This paper highlights the vulnerabilities created by the rise of connectivity, cloud-based Infrastructure-as-a-Service and the Internet-of-Things. It highlights the tendency of security breaches to occur in the supply-chain, indicating the vulnerabilities that have arisen where Telcos lose line-of-sight and control over their own networks. For all the sophistication of our technological systems, human error remains a major vulnerability. As the space industry faces convergence on a number of levels in the coming decade - between infrastructure supported by national space agencies and private players; between military and civil purposes; between space-based and terrestrial infrastructure; and between devices - these risks will increase. This paper represents an opportunity to share “lessons learned” in the Telco sector with the space industry. The author proposes counter-measures to establish and maintain resilience through risk-based cybersecurity governance frameworks in order to mitigate the risk of cybersecurity attack.

AB Spoofing using photographs or videos is one of the most common methods of attacking face recognition and verification systems. In this paper, we propose a real-time and nonintrusive method based on the diffusion speed of a single image to address this problem. In particular, inspired by the observation that the difference in surface properties between a live face and a fake one is efficiently revealed in the diffusion speed, we exploit antispoofing features by utilizing the total variation flow scheme. More specifically, we propose defining the local patterns of the diffusion speed, the so-called local speed patterns, as our features, which are input into the linear SVM classifier to determine whether the given face is fake or not. One important advantage of the proposed method is that, in contrast to previous approaches, it accurately identifies diverse malicious attacks regardless of the medium of the image, e.g., paper or screen. Moreover, the proposed method does not require any specific user action. Experimental results on various data sets show that the proposed method is effective for face liveness detection as compared with previous approaches proposed in studies in the literature. © 2015 IEEE.

AB The vulnerability of most existing face recognition and authentication systems against face presentation attacks (a.k.a. face spoofing attacks) has been mentioned and studied in many works. This paper introduces a novel parametric approach for face PAD using a statistical model of image noise. In fact, facial images from a presentation attack contain specific textural information caused by the presentation process which makes them different from bona-fide images. The subtle difference between bona-fide and presentation attack images can be interpreted by the difference regarding noise statistics within the skin zone of the face. Our solution is casted in the hypothesis testing framework. A new database for face PAD containing face bona-fide images and images of high-quality presentation attacks has been also introduced. The performance of the proposed approach was proven in the mentioned database. Experimental results show that, in a controlled situation, our solution performs better than the other approaches in the literature. © 2013 IEEE.

AB With the development of face recognition system towards automation and unsupervised, illegal intruders have become a serious threat to face authentication system by disguising face authentication system, how to ensure the security of the face recognition system has become an urgent problem in face recognition technology. Therefore, living face detection has become an important issue that must be solved in the face authentication system. By deeply studying the importance of facial image color feature information for human face detection, a deep feature fusion network structure is constructed by deep convolutional neural networks ResNet and SENet to effectively train the involved face anti-spoof data. The feature with large amount of information, while suppressing the features with low usefulness, the experimental results are greatly improved compared with the traditional methods, and have higher recognition effect and accuracy. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.

AB A face spoofing attack occurs when an intruder attempts to impersonate someone with a desirable authentication clearance. To detect such intrusions, many researchers have dedicated their efforts to study visual liveness detection as the primary indicator to block spoofing violations. In this work, we contemplate low-power devices through the combination of Fourier transforms, different classification methods, and low-level feature descriptors to estimate whether probe samples correspond to spoofing attacks. The proposed method has low-computational cost and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach associating features extracted from both spatial and frequency domains. We conduct experiments with embeddings of Support Vector Machines and Partial Least Squares on recent and well-known datasets under same and cross-database settings. Results show that, even though devised towards resource-limited single-board computers, our approach is able to achieve significant results, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB With the wide deployment of the face recognition system, many face attacks, such as print attack, video attack and 3D face mask, have emerged. Face anti-spoofing is very important to protect face recognition system from attack. This paper proposes a structure of generative adversarial networks with skip connection for face anti-spoofing. First, we obtain the latent spatial features of faces by training generative adversarial networks to reconstruct both real and spoof faces; second, we use the convolution neural networks to detect the spoofing faces. In this paper, the proposed method is evaluated by three public databases. The results suggest that our approach achieves as high as 98% accuracy on both CASIA-FASD and REPLAY-ATTACK databases. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI Face and fingerprint recognition in real time system

DE Biometric system; Face and fingerprint recogniti; Real time system;
AB In recent years, it has been witnessed that evolution of biometric technology from the first work in face and fingerprint recognition to the present state of development. Now a huge spectrum of highly accurate systems are found, ranging from highly used modalities, such as fingerprint, face, iris to more marginal ones, such as signature and hand. This path of technological development has led to a serious issue that has only started to be addressed in recent times as the resistance of this rapidly emerging technology to external attacks and, in particularly spoofing. Spoofing, known by the term presentation attack in current standards, is fully biometric vulnerability that is not shared with other IT security solutions. It is known to fool a biometric system into recognizing a fake user as a true one by means of showing a synthetic forged version of the original biometric trait to the sensor. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview on the work that has been carried out using both the face and fingerprint recognition in Real time system. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

AB Modern biometric systems based on face recognition demonstrate high recognition quality, but they are vulnerable to face presentation attacks, such as photo or replay attack. Existing face antispoofing methods are mostly based on texture analysis and due to lack of training data either use hand-crafted features or fine-tuned pretrained deep models. In this paper we present a novel CNNbased approach for face anti-spoofing, based on joint analysis of the presence of a spoofing medium and eye blinking. For training our classifiers we propose the procedure of synthetic data generation which allows us to train powerful deep models from scratch. Experimental analysis on the challenging datasets (CASIA-FASD, NUUA Imposter) shows that our method can obtain state-ofthe- art results. © 2019, Institution of Russian Academy of Sciences.

TI Presentation attack detection for face in mobile phones
SO Advances in Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
LA English
DT SER
AB Face is the most accessible biometric modality which can be used for identity verification in mobile phone applications, and it is vulnerable to many different presentation attacks, such as using a printed face/digital screen face to access the mobile phone. Presentation attack detection is a very critical step before feeding the face image to face recognition systems. In this chapter, we introduce a novel two-stream CNN-based approach for the presentation attack detection, by extracting the patch-based features and holistic depth maps from the face images. We also introduce a two-stream CNN v2 with model optimization, compression and a strategy of continuous updating. The CNN v2 shows great performances of both generalization and efficiency. Extensive experiments are conducted on the challenging databases (CASIA-FASD, MSU-USSA, replay attack, OULU-NPU, and SiW), with comparison to the state of the art. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB Traditional password-based solutions are being predominantly replaced by biometric technology for mobile user authentication. Since the inception of smartphones, smartphone cameras have made substantial progress in image resolution, aperture size, and sensor size. These advances facilitate the use of selfie biometrics such as the self-acquired face, fingerphoto, and ocular region for mobile user authentication. This chapter introduces the topic of selfie biometrics to the readers. Overview of the methods for different selfie biometrics modalities is provided. Liveness detection, soft-biometrics prediction, and cloud-based infrastructure for selfie biometrics are also discussed. Open issues and research directions are included to provide the path forward. The overall aim is to improve the understanding and advance the state-of-the-art in this field. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB Face spoofing attack is an attempt to obtain unauthorized access by using photos, videos or 3D maps of an user’s face. In this work, we propose a software-based anti-spoofing method that extracts multiple texture features based on Local Binary Patterns (LBP) in the grayscale and YCbCr color spaces to train binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, which is then used to classify faces. The proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art methods using Attack Presentation Classification Error Rate (APCER), Normal Presentation Classification Error Rate (NPCER), Average Classification Error Rate (ACER), True Positive Rate (TPR), True Negative Rate (TNR), False Positive Rate (FPR), and Accuracy. Our method performs better than the other state-of-the-art methods when classifying spoofed and non-spoofed faces of the NUAA dataset. In particular, our method presents the smallest FPR, and thus guarantees robustness against spoofing attacks. Furthermore, our anti-spoofing method can be used in real-time applications with an average of 26 frames per second, providing high accuracy with little overhead to authentication systems. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB Background: The first classification of angioedema without wheals was recently reported and comprises different forms of the disease distinguished by aetiology, mediator of oedema and inheritance. Methods: In total, 1725 consecutive patients with angioedema without wheals were examined at our centre between 1993 and 2012. We excluded from the analysis 667 patients because of incomplete data or because angioedema was related to a specific factor. Results: According to the new classification of angioedema, the 1058 patients included in this analysis were diagnosed with hereditary (HAE; n = 377) or acquired angioedema (AAE; n = 681). The former group included HAE with C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency (C1-INH-HAE; n = 353) and HAE with normal C1-INH levels (n = 24), of which six had a factor XII mutation (FXII-HAE) and 18 had disease of unknown origin (U-HAE). The AAE group included disease with C1-INH deficiency (C1-INH-AAE; n = 49), AAE related to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment (n = 183), idiopathic histaminergic (IH-AAE; n = 379) and idiopathic nonhistaminergic angioedema (InH-AAE; n = 70). We compared hereditary and AAE with uncertain aetiopathogenesis: the FXII-HAE and U-HAE groups pooled (FXII/U-HAE) versus InH-AAE. The median age at onset of FXII/U-HAE and InH-AAE was 26 and 38 years, respectively. In addition, 56% of patients with FXII/U-HAE and 81% of those with InH-AAE reported more than five attacks per year (median duration of 48 h). The location of angioedema in patients with FXII/U-HAE versus those with InH-AAE was the following: face, 70% versus 86%; tongue, oral cavity or larynx, 55% versus 68%; limbs, 70% versus 56%; and gastrointestinal mucosa, 50% versus 20%. Prophylaxis with tranexamic acid was effective in all six patients with U-HAE and in 37 of 38 with InH-AAE who were started on this treatment. Conclusion: Our findings in this cohort of patients with angioedema provide new information on the clinical characteristics, diagnosis and treatment of this disease. © 2014 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.

AB Fingerprint Liveness detection, or presentation attacks detection (PAD), that is, the ability of detecting if a fingerprint submitted to an electronic capture device is authentic or made up of some artificial materials, boosted the attention of the scientific community and recently machine learning approaches based on deep networks opened novel scenarios. A significant step ahead was due thanks to the public availability of large sets of data; in particular, the ones released during the International Fingerprint Liveness Detection Competition (LivDet). Among others, the fifth edition carried on in 2017, challenged the participants in two more challenges which were not detailed in the official report. In this paper, we want to extend that report by focusing on them: the first one was aimed at exploring the case in which the PAD is integrated into a fingerprint verification systems, where templates of users are available too and the designer is not constrained to refer only to a generic users population for the PAD settings. The second one faces with the exploitation ability of attackers of the provided fakes, and how this ability impacts on the final performance. These two challenges together may set at which extent the fingerprint presentation attacks are an actual threat and how to exploit additional information to make the PAD more effective. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB Face authentication systems are becoming more and more prevalent, but it has an intrinsic vulnerability against the media-based face forgery (MFF) where adversaries display photos or videos containing victims’ faces to deceive face authentication systems. Liveness detection is an important defense technique to prevent such attacks. In this paper, we propose a practical and effective liveness detection mechanism to protect the face authentication system against the MFF-based attacks. Our approach send the challenge to the user in random and the camera capture the response as a video. The Local Binary Pattern (LBP) is a widely used descriptor in texture analysis due to its efficiency. We utilize δ-LBP, a LBP variant, to detect the expression frame from the video. Additionally, We improve the original LBP by using proper sampling radius in different subareas of a facial image and apply the approach in extracting the facial texture feature from the expression frame as a histogram. Our method detects the MFF-based attacks by measuring the consistency between the LBP histogram and the real facial texture feature. To demonstrate its effectiveness, We collect real-world photo data and video data from both legitimate authentication requests and the MFF-based attacks. The experiment results show that it can detect the MFF-based attacks with an accuracy of 96.45%. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB The wearable IoT monitor device becomes increasingly popular in a market where heart-rate monitors, pulse oximeters sensor are integrated into a device and already play an important role in everyday life. With these considerations in mind, it is important to maintain the security and privacy of users. Biometric authentication offers several benefits such as improved facilitation, enablement, and automation. However, traditional biometric modalities such as fingerprint, face, and iris require specific hardware or sensors to capture the biometric. In this paper, we introduce next-generation biometric called photoplethysmograph (PPG) that are internal to the body, offering a number of advantages. First of all, they are harder to clone, to harvest and to potentially hack, by the nature of the fact they are internal. Other benefits include liveness detection, and interoperability, which traditional modalities don't necessarily have. In this study, we developed the PPG biometric-based key generation that can be extracted by our adaptive quantization approach. The experimental result is shown that 175 key bits with 99.9% average reliability and 0.89 min-entropy can be achieved. © 2019 SPIE. Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.

AB Lately, the enhanced wealthy sensing functionality on mobile devices and computing capability progressed to the ubiquitous application of speech recognition. The recent procedure of security in mobile phone applications is extremely considered, particularly in mobile banking applications. In order to stop utilizers’ privacy through leakage, most of the mobile devices have used a biometric that are established authentication, as voiceprint authentications, recognition of face, fingerprint, to make the privacy protection grow. As well as, these approximation are helpless for replaying offensive. In spite of that the newest solutions employ the liveness to struggle offensive, the approaches recently are critical for ambient’ environments, for instance the audible noises’ surrounding and ambient lights. In the last direction, we investigated the verification of liveness of the utilizer leveraging of authentication utilizers’ movements of mouth which is strong in the environments of noisy. In this report proposed, VSA, reading of lip –established system of utilizer authentication, in which summarized single behavioural features of the utilizers’ mouth speaking by acoustic feeling on the smart devices to authentication of utilizer. This study firstly investigated the Doppler profiles at the signals of acoustic occurred by the utilizers’ mouth speaking and discover the patterns’ movement of mouth of the individual are existing for several individuals. In order to describe the movements of mouth, proposed a method of deep learning-established to summarize the characterises that efficient by the Doppler shapes and use the function’s softmax, supporting the vector domain characterization, as well as supporting the vector machine, for building spoofer detection, spoofer detectors, binary classifiers, multi-class identifier, mouth state identification, and for user identification, respectively. Subsequently, it has improved the approach a balanced binary tree-established authentication to carefully distinguish every singular leveraging these spoofer detectors and classifiers of binary with respect to the utilizer that are registered. Although extensive experience encompassing 46 volunteers in the four true environments, the VSA could obtain 93.1% in spoofer discovery accuracy, and 90.2% accuracy in utilizer identification. © International Research Publication House.

AB Face recognition. A promise made to the modern technologists as the ultimate access control or surveillance technology. However, it is still vulnerable to inexpensive spoofing attacks, which pose a threat to security. Basic face spoofing attacks that use photographs and video are still not addressed appropriately, especially in real-time applications, thereby making security in these environments a difficult task to achieve. Although methods have improved over the last decade, a robust solution that can accommodate changing environments is still out of reach. Face spoofing attacks introduce an object into the scene, which presents curvilinear singularities that are not necessarily portrayed in the same way in different lighting conditions. We present a solution that addresses this problem by using a discrete shearlet transform as an alternative descriptor that can differentiate between a real and a fake face without user-cooperation. We have found the approach can successfully detect blurred edges, texture changes and other noise found in various face spoof attacks. Our benchmarks on the publicly available CASIA-FASD, MSU-MFSD, and OULU-NPU data sets, show that our approach portrays good results and improves on the most popular methods found in the field on modest computer hardware, but requires further improvement to beat the current state of the art. The approach also achieves real-time face spoof discrimination, which makes it a practical solution in real-time applications and a viable augmentation to current face recognition methods. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB Objective: Rare disease Background: Krabbe disease, or globoid cell leukodystrophy, is an autosomal recessive disease caused by the deficiency of lysosomal galactocerebrosidase. The most common form is infantile Krabbe disease, which is usually diagnosed within the first year of life and has high morbidity and mortality. Patients usually present with irritability, progressive neurodegeneration, spasticity, and peripheral neuropathy. This report is of a 6-year-old girl who had Krabbe disease since she was 5 weeks of age. Case Report: A 6-year-old female Saudi patient had initially presented at 5 weeks of age with hypoventilation, recurrent attacks of fever, and failure to thrive. The patient also skin hypopigmentation involving the face, neck, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Peripheral blood galactocerebrosidase enzyme activity was normal but was reduced in tissue fibroblasts. Whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) showed a homozygous mutation in the GALC gene c.334A>G (p.Thr112Ala), which was previously reported in a compound heterozygous state with another mutation. Conclusions: This case report describes a patient with homozygous mutation status Krabbe disease. Although this patient had the phenotype of early infantile-onset Krabbe disease, which usually has high morbidity and mortality, her condition is now relatively stable at 6 years of age, which could be due to relatively higher enzyme activity. This case also expanded the presentation or typical phenotype of infantile Krabbe disease as the patient also presented with hypoventilation and skin hypopigmentation. © Am J Case Rep, 2019.

TI Effects of visible and near infrared polarized lights on spoofing face
SO Journal of Computer Science
LA English
DT JOUR
DE Anti-spoofing; Face biometric; Polarization imaging system; Polarized light; Spoofing attacks;
AB Face spoofing countermeasure is vital to avoid an imposter from gaining access to security biometric systems by using face masks in various forms that mimic a valid user face. Recently, several studies have shown the ability of visible polarized light in distinguishing real and fake faces. In this paper, polarization imaging systems using visible and near infrared (NIR) are proposed to examine the effects on the polarization images as trial to distinguish between genuine face and spoof face presentation attacks: photo paper and iPad face display; based on the optical properties of the materials. The findings from the investigations suggest that in general, NIR light could not be used to distinguish between genuine face and photo paper under a polarization lighting condition. In contrast, the visible light provides significant difference of the Stokes images between the materials. Classification between real face and iPad display can easily be done by manipulating the polarization angle. A new feature fusion formula named as the SDOLP3F is introduced to differentiate between the real and the fake traits. The SDOLP3F results presented in this paper show the highest accuracy rate compared to the individual measures. The results illustrate the robustness of the proposed anti-spoofing algorithm based on a small sample. © 2019 Azim Zaliha Abd Aziz.

AB In this article we describe the implementation of a reliable and innovative ensemble-based technique that can prevent face spoofing attacks. The presented software is part of a technology developed in partnership with IsItYou, an Israeli company, that attempts to replace passwords with a face-based authentication system. Since the main problem of biometric systems is represented by the spoof attacks, IsItYou came with a solution to this, developing a unique technology that can identify spoof attacks, and authenticate only authorized humans. Inspired from deep learning techniques where ensemble-based solutions improve machine learning results by uniting several models, a software ensemble that combines multiple anti-spoofing methods, covering a larger range of spoof attacks and increasing overall security was developed. The article also shows the performances results and implementation details. The experimental results signpost our solution can provide first-rate results compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. © 2012-2019.

AB Spoofing with photograph or video is one of the most common manner to circumvent a face recognition system. In this paper, we present a real-time and non-intrusive method to address this based on individual images from a generic webcamera. The task is formulated as a binary classification problem, in which, however, the distribution of positive and negative are largely overlapping in the input space, and a suitable representation space is hence of importance. Using the Lambertian model, we propose two strategies to extract the essential information about different surface properties of a live human face or a photograph, in terms of latent samples. Based on these, we develop two new extensions to the sparse logistic regression model which allow quick and accurate spoof detection. Primary experiments on a large photo imposter database show that the proposed method gives preferable detection performance compared to others. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB The vulnerabilities of face biometric authentication systems to spoofing attacks have received a significant attention during the recent years. Some of the proposed countermeasures have achieved impressive results when evaluated on intratests, i.e., the system is trained and tested on the same database. Unfortunately, most of these techniques fail to generalize well to unseen attacks, e.g., when the system is trained on one database and then evaluated on another database. This is a major concern in biometric antispoofing research that is mostly overlooked. In this letter, we propose a novel solution based on describing the facial appearance by applying Fisher vector encoding on speeded-up robust features extracted from different color spaces. The evaluation of our countermeasure on three challenging benchmark face-spoofing databases, namely the CASIA face antispoofing database, the replay-attack database, and MSU mobile face spoof database, showed excellent and stable performance across all the three datasets. Most importantly, in interdatabase tests, our proposed approach outperforms the state of the art and yields very promising generalization capabilities, even when only limited training data are used. © 1994-2012 IEEE.

AB Facial recognition has been employed as a user-friendly person authentication method, and facial spoofing attack has become a common problem. Although there are two kinds of facial spoofing attacks, 2D spoofing and 3D spoofing, almost studies evaluate the performance only for 2D spoofing. Temporal change of face color will be a possible characteristic to detect liveness against to 3D spoofing attack because there is a relationship between the skin blood perfusion change and the temporal color change in facial video images. This paper proposes two features, R-G correlation feature and inter-area correlation feature, to detect liveness using video images. Also, liveness detection method using support vector machine is demonstrated. The performance was evaluated by accuracy (ACC) for classifying liveness face and three types of spoofing face - 2D printed image, 2D monitor image, and 3D doll. The ACC was 99.2% at the lighting condition of room light, 99.5% at sunlight illuminating the face, and 98.6% at sunlight illuminating the back of the head. © 2019 The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

AB In this paper we study face Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) against realistic 3D mask and high quality photo attacks in dynamic scenarios. We perform a comparison between a new pulse-based PAD approach based on a combination of a skin detector and a chrominance method, and the system used in our previous works (based on Blind Source Separation techniques, BSS). We also propose and study heuristical and statistical approaches for performing continuous PAD with low latency and false non-match rate. Results are reported using the 3D Mask Attack Database (3DMAD), and a self-collected dataset called BiDA Heart Rate Database (BiDA HR) including different video durations, resolutions, frame rates and attack artifacts. Several conclusions can be drawn from this work: (1) chrominance and BSS methods perform similarly under the controlled and favorable conditions found in 3DMAD and BiDA HR, (2) combining pulse information extracted from short-time sequences (e.g. 3 s) can be discriminant enough for performing the PAD task, (3) a high increase in PAD performance can be achieved with simple PAD score combination, and (4) the statistical method for continuous PAD outperforms the simple PAD score combination but it needs more data for building the statistical models. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB With the extensive use of biometric systems at most of the places for authentication, there are security and privacy issues concerning with it. Most of the public places we usually visit are under reconnaissance and may keep track of face, fingerprints, and iris etc. Thus, biometric information is not secret anymore and sensitive to spoofing attacks. Therefore, not only biometric traits but also liveness detection must be deployed in an authentication mechanism which is a challenging task. Iris is the most accurate trait and increasingly in demand in applications like national security, duplicate-free voter registration list, and Aadhar program its detection must be made robust. Solution to the iris liveness detection by extracting distinctive textural features from genuine (live) and fake (print) patterns using statistical approaches GLCM and GLRLM are implemented. Popular supervised SVM algorithm and PatternNet neural network with second-order scaled conjugate gradient training algorithm are assessed. Both of these algorithms are found to be faster with PatternNet outperforms over SVM. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB In the current context of digital transformation, the increasing trend in the use of personal devices for accessing online services has fostered the necessity of secure cyberphysical solutions. Biometric technologies for mobile devices, and face recognition specifically, have emerged as a secure and convenient approach. However, such a mobile scenario also brings some specific threats, and spoofing attack detection is, without any doubt, one of the most challenging. Although much effort has been devoted in anti-spoofing techniques over the past few years, there are still many challenges to be solved when implementing these systems in real use cases. This chapter analyses some of the gaps between research and real scenario deployments, including generalisation, usability, and performance. More specifically, we will focus on how to select and configure an algorithm for real scenario deployments, paying special attention to use cases involving limited processing capacity devices (e.g., mobile devices), and we will present a publicly available evaluation framework for this purpose. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB The Biometrics of the ears have both advantages and disadvantages compared to other physical attributes. The small surface and the relatively simple structure have a controversial effect. In a positive way, these features provide faster processing compared to face detection and make detection easier compared to fingerprints. On the other side, like other biometrics, current ear biometric recognition systems are vulnerable to attacks. A spoofing attack occurs at sensor level and every impostor can masquerade as someone else by altering data, thus, obtaining an illegitimate access. Due to a lack of anti-spoofing databases, that would support this paper, ear fake databases have been built using different mobile phones. In this paper, an ear presentation attack detection database is collected which contains a various range of variations of potential attacks. In particular, the database consists of two main parts, a) AMI dataset which has 700 ear images and we make display attack by using them, b) data collected at University of Tabriz containing 20 genuine subjects and fake ears which are made from the genuine ears. Different mobile phones are used for collecting the database. Three fake ear attacks are implemented which include video attack, printed attack, and display attack. Consequently, for each subject, 2 videos (left and right ears), 8 different images, and the final database contain 10 video clips and 160 images are prepared. General Image Quality Assessment is used as a baseline algorithm for comparison which is used vastly in the liveness detection purpose. Releasing the first database in ear liveness detection can open new ways for investigating on ear biometrics systems more confidently to use future research on mobile smartphones. © 2018 IEEE.

AB Biometrics has been increasingly used as a safe and convenient technique for people identification. Despite the higher security of biometric systems, criminals have already developed methods to circumvent them, being the presentation of fake biometric information to the input sensor (spoofing attack) the easiest way. Face is considered one of the most promising biometric traits for people identification, including in mobile devices. However, face recognition systems can be easily fooled, for instance, by presenting to the sensor a printed photograph, a 3D mask, or a video recorded from the face of a legal user. Recently, despite some CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) based approaches have achieved state-of-the-art results in face spoofing detection, in most of the cases the proposed architectures are very deep, being unsuitable for devices with hardware restrictions. In this work, we propose an efficient architecture for face spoofing detection based on a width-extended CNN, which we called wCNN. Each part of wCNN is trained, separately, in a given region of the face, then their outputs are combined in order to decide whether the face presented to the sensor is real or fake. The proposed approach, which learns deep local features from each facial region due to its width-wide architecture, presented better accuracy than state-of-the-art methods, including the well-referenced fine-tuned VGG-Face, while being much more efficient regarding hardware resources and processing time. © 2018 IEEE.

AB Face recognition as an identity authentication has been widely used in commodity mobile systems. However due to increasing attacks against face recognition algorithms, mobile systems users begin to concern about the security and reliability of face recognition modules in their mobile devices. In China, many commercial devices manufacturers prefer to adapt web-based API to their devices as the user authentication method. In this paper, we focus on accuracy and reliability performance in both Baidu and Face++ face comparison API. To make a comparison, we also tested on Google facenet as the baseline. The result shows that liveness detection method has not been widely applied in web based API. Those without liveness detection will be vulnerable to presentation attack. Depends on the security level, a certain mount of presentation attack could be prevented by current liveness detection method. © 2018 IEEE.

AB Background Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare and potentially life-threatening disease. New specific treatments are available. Objective To identify patients' features and patients' best therapeutic option. Methods A 1-year, multicenter, retrospective study was performed. The primary objective was to examine the clinical presentation of HAE. Secondary objectives included patient characteristics, management of HAE over 12 months, and health-related quality of life using the SF-36v2 questionnaire. Results One hundred ninety-three patients were included, and 69.4% were women. In the 12-month period, the mean number of HAE attacks was 7.6. Among the 568 reported attacks, localizations were the abdomen (57.1%), peripheral limbs (42.5%), upper airway (7.9%), and face (6.9%); 31.6% of attacks were severe and occurred statistically more often in women (P <.02). Compared with a population of allergic patients, all age- and sex-adjusted scores were significantly lower in patients with HAE (P <.05) except for the physical component summary. Health-related quality of life negatively correlated with the annual number of attacks and was markedly altered for patients having more than 5 attacks per year (P <.05 for all dimensions). Conclusion HAE is a severe disease that places a heavy burden on quality of life. © 2013 American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB To satisfy the high accuracy demand of liveness detection, a face authentication system (FAS) for specific environment was designed. First the face was identified, and then a liveness detection was implemented on the identified image. A specific test model was established for each specific individual with a strong pertinence. Local binary pattern (LBP), histogram of oriented gradient (HOG), gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), Haar-like (HAAR) methods were used to extract features for each legal user's liveness facial images and photo facial images, and then a support vector machine (SVM) net was used for the liveness proof. The proposed method was validated on a public database of NUAA with the correct detection rate of 100%. The experimental results show that the detection module based on special environmental not only has a high detection accuracy, but also can meet the needs of special environment. © 2018, Editorial Board of Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

AB Background: Angioedema due to acquired deficiency of C1-inhibitor (C1-INH-AAE) is a rare disease sharing some clinical and laboratory similarities with hereditary angioedema, but with late onset and no positive family history. The underlining cause may be malignant or due to autoimmune diseases, but some cases remain idiopathic. Case presentation: We report a case of a 75 year old woman suffering from recurrent episodes of angioedema since the age of 66, considered first induced by treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI). She continued to have angioedema attacks during 6 years after discontinuation of ACEI, until evaluation in our clinic in 2014, when C1 inhibitor esterase (C1-INH) deficiency was confirmed. The extended medical evaluation for inflammatory, allergic, autoimmune and neoplasic diseases was negative. C1-INH and complement fraction C4 plasma levels were significantly decreased at all measurements, but no diagnostic criteria for diseases known to induce C1-INH deficiency could be found. We first initiated daily prophylactic treatment with tranexamic acid, with no amelioration after 3 months. During the last and most severe attack, with the first facial and laryngeal edema, we have switched to attenuated androgen danazol. The evolution was very good, with prompt remission of angioedema and significant increase of C1-INH and C4 plasma levels after 2 weeks of daily danazol use. She completed 3 years of continuous treatment with low daily maintenance dose of danazol (ongoing), with no angioedema attack. We closely monitored C1-INH and C4 plasma levels, possible danazol side effects and any signs suggesting late onset of C1-INH deficiency causal disease. Conclusion: We reported a particular case of rare angioedema due to acquired deficiency of C1-inhibitor, which has no clear cause after long follow-up, but good response to attenuated androgen. We concluded that the awareness of angioedema due to C1-INH deficiency should be increased within medical community and therapeutic options should be more clearly indicated and available for all diagnosed cases. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB With the development of face detection technology in identity authentication system, human face detection technology is becoming more and more important. It is very easy to use photographs and videos and other ways to get fake face to attack the identity authentication system. This paper designs a method on judging the authenticity of faces based on the texture feature difference between real face images and deception photos. The system is constructed by VC++ and OpenCV, mainly composed of image reading, face and facial features detection, image block feature extraction and classification of the support vector machine. In this paper, sparse support vector machine is used to train and classify data, and the application of sparse support vector machine in liveness detection is the innovation point of this paper. The results of experiments on a specific database show that it has good performance in terms of accuracy and speed. © 2018 IEEE.

AB Despite their advantages over password-based and token-based authentication, Biometric Authentication Systems (BAS) are not perfect. They are particularly vulnerable to spoofing, also called Suspicious Presentation (SP) attacks whereby an impostor presents a fake trait to the biometric scanner during verification. Spoofing has a critical impact on system security leading to a trust deficit on biometric systems with weak anti-spoofing mechanisms. Mitigating biometric spoofing is a possibility, hence several techniques have evolved in recent times including multi-biometrics, biometric cryptography and Liveness Detection (LD)-also called Suspicious Presentation Detection (SPD). Unfortunately, nearly all known LD techniques exhibit a fundamental set of flaws – they are mostly uni-modal, easily predictable by a well-equipped impostor, and can be circumvented by well-crafted SP attacks. This paper presents the Multi-Modal Random Trait Biometric Liveness Detection System (MMRTBLDS) framework, as an alternative approach that implements LD using multiple traits each acquired from separate modalities of the same subject combined in a randomized manner. The strength of the framework lays in the impostor’s inability to accurately predict the exact set of randomized trait parameter combinations in advance of LD. The framework employs a 3D simulation of fifteen liveness parameters, composed of three each from finger, face and iris traits, based on random number generation. Simulation results obtained using 125 distinct randomized combinations show significant improvements in biometric authentication security with a system efficiency of 99.2%. © 2018, UK Simulation Society.

AB Monitoring vital signals, including pulse rate is a crucial process to detect cardiovascular disorders and body liveness. Some of the clinically used techniques might cause irritation or discomfort for patients. This paper presents a contactless, non-invasive camera-based method of extracting pulse rate from a video stream without attaching electrodes to the skin. The introduced method is a colour-based approach that can estimate heart rate through amplifying subtle changes in skin colour which caused by blood circulation. When evaluated on 7 subjects, this approach reported similar heart rates comparing to a reference oximeter system, however, this method is sensitive to motion artefact and light noise. © 2018 IEEE.

AB Currently, face recognition is widely used in many applications including access and security systems. However, a malicious user can spoof such systems by using a photo or recorded video of a legitimate user to gain access. Therefore, it is essential to solve this problem using anti-spoofing measures that can determine whether the face image presented to the system is genuine or a spoof. In this paper, we proposed a novel anti-spoofing system based on local texture features. The local features of the input image are extracted using Quaternionic Local Ranking Binary Pattern (QLRBP). We evaluate the effectiveness of these features using two different classifiers, namely the K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM). Our experiments using publicly available datasets show that our proposed system could achieve up to 95.20% accuracy (at 205.62 ms per frame) using the KNN classifier. Using the SVM, our proposed system can achieve up to 97.36% accuracy at 229.39 ms per frame. These results show that the QLRBP features are suitable to be used in a face anti-spoofing applications. © 2018 IEEE.

AB Objectives: Acute gout is a common arthritis that may eventually develop into chronic tophaceous gout (CTG). CTG usually is manifested by recurrent gout attacks. The diagnosis and treatment of CTG is challenging. Although the emergence of CTG without previous gout attacks is uncommon, it is important to recognize this unusual gout presentation. Methods: Herein, we present two cases of CTG, occurring in elderly patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on diuretics, who presented without a prior history of acute gout attacks. We also searched PUBMED, Ovid MEDLINE, and Google scholar (1970–2017), for “tophi as the initial manifestation of gout” and “chronic gout without previous attacks” and extracted relevant data. Results: The search disclosed one retrospective study and several case reports and case series describing 96 patients. Clinical and laboratory data was extracted from 34 patients. We found that a specific group of patients, e.g., elderly patients, most often female patients, suffering from CKD, and treated with diuretics, are specifically reported in the English medical literature to present with CTG as their first manifestation of gout. Conclusion: The two cases and our literature review try to emphasize the many faces of chronic gout, in particular, its presentation without previous gout attacks. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB With the wide applications of user authentication based on face recognition, face spoof attacks against face recognition systems are drawing increasing attentions. While emerging approaches of face antispoofing have been reported in recent years, most of them limit to the non-realistic intra-database testing scenarios instead of the crossdatabase testing scenarios. We propose a robust representation integrating deep texture features and face movement cue like eye-blink as countermeasures for presentation attacks like photos and replays. We learn deep texture features from both aligned facial images and whole frames, and use a frame difference based approach for eye-blink detection. A face video clip is classified as live if it is categorized as live using both cues. Cross-database testing on public-domain face databases shows that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.

AB Background: In face of the growing threat of terrorist-related attacks in Europe, Germany is making more and more efforts to be prepared for a possible terrorist incident. In Germany data concerning the incidence and results of treatment of gunshot and blast injuries are rare and in most cases collected retrospectively. To prepare for possible terrorist events the German Society of Trauma Surgery (DGU) and the Central Armed Forces have introduced a 5-point plan. One essential topic for the scientific evaluation and follow-up of this challenging process for society is to extend the German trauma registry DGU with a module for gunshot and blast injuries (“Schuss- und Explosionsregister”, SExReg), containing a data set to record severely injured patients. Aim: The aim of this paper is to present the development of the database and to show the first results of the newly established registry for gunshot and blast injuries. Material and methods: The original database was developed and established at the German Armed Forces Central Hospital at Koblenz and the anonymous data of patients with gunshot and blast injuries treated were primarily collected. To evaluate the clinical course of these casualties, a set of 140 different parameters were finalized and represent the basic scaffold of the new registry. Results: A total of 179 patients treated at the German Armed Forces Central Hospital at Koblenz from 2004 to 2016 could be included. Based on some parameters it could be shown which resources are needed and what functional outcome could be achieved. In parallel our findings indicate significant differences between individual subgroups. Discussion: We could demonstrate the special benefits of a registry for gunshot and blast injuries and identified in particular the needs of further development and modifications of the SExReg to prospectively evaluate the outcome of gunshot and blast injuries in Germany. © 2018, Springer Verlag.

AB We present a novel approach to liveness verification based on visual speech recognition within a challenge-based framework which has the potential to be used on mobile devices to prevent replay or spoof attacks during Face-based liveness verification. The system uses model visual speech recognition and determines liveness based on the Levenshtein Distance between a randomly generated challenge phrase and the hypothesis utterances from the visual speech recognizer. A Deep learning-based approach to visual speech recognition is used to improve upon the state of the art for the use of visual speech recognition for liveness verification. © 2017 Infonomics Society.

AB Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a potentially fatal progressive complication of measles virus infection of the brain occurring in children and adolescents. It typically presents with a progressive decline in cognitive abilities along with periodic myoclonic jerks. We report a case of SSPE with atypical presentation. Our patient presented with intermittent drop attacks without any obvious myoclonic jerks or cognitive decline making his diagnosis difficult. Atypical manifestations of SSPE occur in 10% of patients, and a high index of suspicion is necessary for early diagnosis and management of this dreaded disease.

AB Increasing use of biometrie authentication systems in the recent years, spoof fingerprint and iris detection has become increasingly important. Biometrics is to discriminate subjects in a reliable manner for a target application based on one or more signals derived from physical or behavioral traits, such as fingerprint, face, iris, voice, palm, or handwritten sign. Biometric technology has several advantages over common security methods based on some information. In this paper, using of the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for iris and fingerprint liveness detection is done. The system is evaluated on the data sets used in the liveness detection competition. The comparing of different models: CNNs pre-trained on natural images and fine-tuned with the fingerprint images, CNN with random weights, and a classical local binary pattern(LBP) approach. It is shown that pre-trained CNNs can yield the state-of-the-art results with no need for architecture or hyper-parameter selection. This model has an overall accuracy of 94%. © 2017 IEEE.

AB Using 2D images in authentication systems raises the question of spoof attacks: is it possible to deceive an authentication system using fake models possessing identical visual properties of the genuine one? In this work, an anti-spoofing method approach for a wine anti-counterfeiting system is presented. The proposed method relies in two different color spaces: CIE L*u*v* and, to distinguish between a genuine instance and a spoof attack. To evaluate the proposed strategy, two databases were used: a private database, with photos/2D attacks of cork stoppers, created for this work; and the public Replay-Attack database that is used for face spoofing detection methods testing. The results on the private database show that the anti-spoofing approach is able to distinguish with high accuracy a real photo from an attack. Regarding the public database, the results were obtained with existing methods, as the best HTER results using a single frame approach. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB We faced the problem of detecting 2-D face spoofing attacks performed by placing a printed photo of a real user in front of the camera. For this type of attack it is not possible to relay just on the face movements as a clue of vitality because the attacker can easily simulate such a case, and also because real users often show a low vitality during the authentication session. In this paper, we perform both video and static analysis in order to employ complementary information about motion, texture and liveness and consequently to obtain a more robust classification. © 2011 IEEE.

AB Moyamoya disease is a vasculopathy causing chronic progressive stenosis and occlusion of the large arteries of the circle of Willis that could lead to brain ischaemia. The condition may also present with haemorrhagic strokes. This is a case report of moyamoya disease in a 32-year-old woman presenting with ischaemic stroke. The report describes her inpatient stay and investigations and findings. The report reviews the main aspects of moyamoya disease definition, epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, classification and treatment. This case is interesting because her first presentation occurred after 3 months of her second delivery. Whether the different physiological stresses of pregnancy, child birth and puerperium have had some effect in accelerating the pathogenesis of her moyamoya disease remains unknown. 1 © BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2018.

AB Spoofing attacks provided by fake individuals are considered as a major interest on biometric systems. To implement a robust face biometric system, deploying a reliable anti-spoofing scheme is needed. The concentration of this study to organize the anti-spoofing technique is on overlapped face textures together with image quality assessment. Our proposed fake detection scheme applies double anti-spoofing solution to distinguish live and fake identities. Firstly, image quality assessment method is used to differentiate fake and real samples by comparing their quality. The fake detection method using overlapped histograms of LBP texture descriptor is then applied for those samples recognized as real to increase the robustness of the biometric system against unreliable quality of images. Proposed spoof detection method presents an effective strategy for detecting fake face samples for video and print attacks. Demonstration of results on public spoof databases clarifies the robustness of the proposed solution for face fake detection. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB Multiple thermal face detection in unconstrained environments has received increasing attention due to its potential in liveness detection and night-time surveillance. This paper presents an effective method based on fully convolutional network (FCN), density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) and non-maximum suppression (NMS) algorithm. Our proposed approach captures the thermal face features automatically using FCN. Then, an improved DBSCAN is used to detect all the faces in the thermal images. Finally, we use NMS to remove all of the bounding-boxes with an IOU (intersection over union). Experiments on RGB-D-T database show that the proposed method exceeds the state-of-the-art algorithms for single face detection on thermal images. We also build a new database with 10K multiple thermal face images in unconstrained environments. The results also show a high precision for multi-face detection tasks. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB Many of the methods has been reported for detection of liveness based on eye flicker are intrusive, in our method detecting liveness using non intrusive. The proposed methodology uses eye flicker activity in an image sequences. The present generic camera will capture the face video with twenty five FPS, frame intervals difference is less than seventy milliseconds. Sequences of images are used in AdaBoost method and Viola Jones technique for the face identification. The Harr like components are figured by convolving the picture with layouts of various size and introduction. Next step is to detect eye region, the position of eye in a face is found on certain geometric dependencies known for human face. If iris is detected in eye region then eye is open. If not, it is closed. Here in this paper we are thinking about eye flicker and iris varieties as a confirmation of liveness to reject utilizing few fake. We tested around more than 20 natural videos to detect the liveness based on eye flicker and achieved 92.50% accuracy. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB With an increase in acceptance of face recognition systems, the desire for accurate biometric authentication - face recognition, has increased. Nowadays, the fundamental limitations of existing systems are, the vulnerabilities of false verification via a picture or simple video of a person. In this paper, it is inspired by how humans can perform reliable spoofing detection only based on the available scene and context information. We propose our framework in a combination of interaction model and Moiŕe pattern analysis to make sure that a user is a real person. It is different from some systems that use hardware-based liveness detection. We focus on the softwarebased approaches, in particular, the necessary algorithms that allow for a liveness detection in real-time. Our experiments results show excellent performance to the state of the art. © 2017 IEEE.

AB Face recognition system is exposed to video replay attacks and photo spoofing attacks along with the extensive use of identity authentication technology. Spoofing attack happens when an attacker tries to disguise as a legitimate user with permissions to spoof authentication system by replaying the recorded videos of legitimate users or utilizing the printed photos of legitimate users. Inspired by the differences between image acquisition and playback, printing properties, and light emission models, this paper proposes a live face detection method based on local binary pattern and Bandelet. The replayed video images and the printed face images usually contain characteristics that are easy to be detected by texture detection and frequency domain analysis. The proposed method analyzes the differences between live faces and photo faces in texture, at the same time it utilizes Bandelet to analyze face images with multi-scale analysis and extracts the high-frequency sub band coefficients as feature vectors to train Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) to classify and recognize. The algorithm is verified on the public CASIA-FASD, print-attack and replay-attack datasets, well known Face Anti-Spoofing Databases, and the experimental results show that the method reduces the computational complexity and improves the detection accuracy.

AB We analyzed the clinical features of symptomatic posterior cerebral artery (PCA) stenosis in 6 patients selected from 15 patients with angiographically documented PCA atherostenosis occurring during a 7‐year period. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) were the major presentation in 5 patients. A homonymous visual field defect was present in 2 patients. TIA symptoms were predominantly visual or sensory, or both. The most common visual symptom was difficulty seeing to one side. One patient saw flashing lights. Sensory spells were always paresthetic, usually involving the arm and hand and occasionally the face and leg. Three patients had visual and sensory spells together. Two patients with a visual field defect had calcarine infarcts found by computed tomography. All patients were treated with warfarin. During followup (4 months to 4 years), no patient had a new stroke in the PCA territory, and only one continued to have TIAs. PCA atherostenosis is rarer than PCA embolic occlusion. In contrast to those with PCA embolism, our patients with PCA atherostenosis had more TIAs and fewer infarcts. The clinical features of PCA stenosis—preponderance of visual and sensory TIAs‐distinguish this vascular lesion from stenosis of the middle cerebral artery.

AB Face liveness verification is an important procedure against fraud for many applications of face recognition. In this paper, a face liveness verification method based on hyperspectrum analysis is proposed. Based on the hyperspectral face images collected by a hyperspectral camera, the spectral characteristics of real human faces and face photos in various lighting conditions and feature positions are studied. Firstly, the most distinguishing spectral bands are selected with a feature selection method. Secondly, the recognition results in single position is obtained using support vector machines (SVM). Lastly, the recognition results of multiple positions are voted to get a final classification result. The experimental results show that human faces display different spectral characteristics in different lighting conditions and feature positions, and the proposed approach can effectively distinguish real human faces from face photos. © 2017 IEEE.

AB Bradykinin-mediated angioedema (AE) is a rare disease characterized by recurrent cutaneous or mucosal angioedema. This hereditary or acquired disease is of rapid installation, non-pruritic, usually painless and can affect the face, lips, larynx, gastrointestinal tract or extremities. When the affected area involves the upper respiratory tract, laryngeal angioedema can lead to imminent death by asphyxia. This is the reason for the high mortality rate (30 %) in undiagnosed or improperly managed patients. High-risk situations in oral and maxillofacial surgery procedures should be identified preoperatively. Short-term prophylaxis must be carried-out prior to any procedure that may trigger an attack. A multi-site reference center (CREAK) has been created to help clinicians to manage this disease. This article reviews the pathophysiologic mechanisms, the clinical presentations, the possible treatments, the acute strategies for attacks and different prophylactic possibilities in oral and maxillofacial surgery. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB The use of image based presentation attack detection (PAD) systems has experienced an enormous growth of interest in recent years. The most accurate techniques in literature addressing this topic rely on the verification of the actual three-dimensionality of the face, which increases complexity and costs of the system. In this work, we propose an effective and low-cost face spoofing detector system to supplement a PPGI-based vital signal monitoring application. Starting from a set of automatically located facial feature points, the movement information of this set of points was obtained. Based on a time series analysis of the landmark position distances using peak descriptors and cross-correlation coefficients as classifiers in a sliding window, life signs have been exploited to develop a system being able to recognize false detections and biometric spoofs. To verify the performance, experiments on three different benchmark datasets (CASIA face anti-spoofing, MSU and IDIAP Replay-Attack databases) were made. The evaluation of the proposed low-cost approach showed good results (accuracy of ~85-95%) compared to more resource-intensive state-of-the-art methods.

TI Impact of global technology megatrends in cybersecurity for pipeline m
SO 2017 Rio Pipeline Conference and Exposition

AB This presentation will discuss how each of the global trends listed below will impact on the way we secure our current architectures and how the modern Pipeline Management Systems must be designed based on integration and interoperability to face the current and the further security challenges. The collaboration between the stakeholders and the alliances between the technological companies are absolutely key to fulfil the interoperability and compatibility requirements as well as to achieve an appropriate level of security with a holistic approach. Historically, security was focused on keeping out potential attackers through a perimeter-based defense. Today, the standard thinking is to expect a successful attack, and to design and defend a network with a defense-in-depth approach to minimize and mitigate any damage. This approach involves a multi-layered, multi-technology, and multi-party strategy to protect critical assets. The continuous evolution of technology directly affects the O&G (Oil and Gas) segment. Most of the global technological trends are producing significant changes in the way the industry faces the challenges of today and tomorrow. Interoperable Open Protocols: Historically, a security-by-obscurity approach was adopted with systems and networks seen as standalone with no public access. Proprietary protocols seen as being difficult to compromise, and security incidents were more likely to be accidental. More recently, closed systems leveraging proprietary or non-interoperable protocols have shifted towards standardized IP protocols and Ethernet-based wired and wireless networks. IT / OT (Information Technologies / Operational Technologies) Convergence: Organizationally, IT and OT teams and tools, which were historically separate, have begun to converge, leading to more traditionally IT-centric solutions being introduced to support operational activities. Although IT information is typically used to make business decisions such as those in process optimization, and OT information is leveraged to make physical decisions such as about closing a valve or increasing pressure, regardless of where a security threat arises, the business must treat it in a similar manner. As the borders between traditionally separate OT and IT domains blur, they must align strategies and work more closely together to ensure end-to-end security. This includes standards-based architecture, management, administration and policy, and communications. Internet of Things: The O&G industry has experienced the connection of a proliferation of new devices to systems to replace existing functions or perform new ones. As pipeline operators continue to adopt new technologies and use cases, new and diverse devices are being conn

AB Even though the field of Face Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) has been around for quite a long time, but still it is quite a new field to be implemented on smartphones. Implementation on smartphones is different because the limited computing power of the smartphones when compared to computers. Presentation Attack for a face recognition system may happen in various ways, using photograph, video or mask of an authentic user's face. The Presentation Attack Detection system is vital to counter those kinds of intrusion. Face presentation attack countermeasures are categorized as sensor level or feature level. Face Presentation Attack Detection through the sensor level technique involved in using additional hardware or sensor to protect recognition system from spoofing while feature level techniques are purely software-based algorithms and analysis. Under the feature level techniques, it may be divided into liveness detection; motion analysis; face appearance properties (texture analysis, reflectance); image quality analysis (image distortion); contextual information; challenge response. There are a few types of research have been done for face PAD on smartphones. They also have released the database they used for their testing and performance benchmarking.

AB Background: Little evidence is available for the effect of nebulised magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) in acute asthma in children. We assessed the effect of MgSO4 treatment in children with severe acute asthma. Methods: In this randomised placebo-controlled, multi-centre, parallel trial, we enrolled children (aged 2-16 years) with severe acute asthma who did not respond to standard inhaled treatment from 30 hospitals in the UK. Children were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive nebulised salbutamol and ipratropium bromide with either 2·5 mL of isotonic MgSO4 (250 mmol/L; 151 mg per dose; MgSO4 group) or 2·5 mL of isotonic saline (placebo group) on three occasions at 20-min intervals. Randomisation was done with a computer-generated randomisation sequence, with random block sizes of two to four. Both patients and researchers were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome measure was the Yung Asthma Severity Score (ASS) at 60 min post-randomisation. We used a statistical significance level of p&lt;0·05 for a between-group difference, but regarded a between-group difference in ASS of 0·5 as the minimal clinically significant treatment effect. Analysis was done by intention to treat. This trial is registered with controlled-trials.com, number ISRCTN81456894. Findings: Between Jan 3, 2009, and March 20, 2011, we recruited and randomly assigned 508 children to treatment: 252 to MgSO4 and 256 to placebo. Mean ASS at 60 min was lower in the MgSO4 group (4·72 [SD 1·37]) than it was in the placebo group (4·95 [SD 1·40]; adjusted difference -0·25, 95% CI -0·48 to -0·02; p=0·03). This difference, however, was not clinically significant. The clinical effect was larger in children with more severe asthma exacerbation (p=0·03) and those with symptoms present for less than 6 h (p=0·049). We detected no difference in the occurrence of adverse events between groups. Interpretation: Overall, nebulised isotonic MgSO4, given as an adjuvant to standard treatment, did not show a clinically significant improvement in mean ASS in children with acute severe asthma. However, the greatest clinical response was seen in children with more severe attacks (SaO2&lt;92%) at presentation and those with preceding symptoms lasting less than 6 h.

AB Aiming to counter photo attack and video attack in face recognition (FR) systems, a content-independent face presentation attack detection scheme based on directional local binary pattern (DLBP) is proposed. In order to minimize the influences of the image content, DLBP is proposed to investigate the noise characteristics of the facial image. By using directional difference filtering, the discrepancies between the real face and the facial artefact in terms of the consistency of adjacent pixels are effectively exploited. With the DLBP feature, the detection is accomplished by using a Softmax classifier. Experiments are done with four public benchmark databases, and the results indicate its effectiveness both in intra-database and cross-database testing. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB Since many decades, various authors have proposed new technique and methods but still the system has to improve to recognise the genuine object faces along with liveness of the object and spoofing objects with increasing in accuracy. However, by considering the various existing methods, were fails in identifying genuine objects faces from various shapes of object faces in different angels and individual differences between the objects. The existing classifier cannot simplifies well to various kind of objects in different directions especially in case of blur images. In order to overcome this problem, we proposed an Face and liveness Detection with Combined Feature Descriptors using Fuzzy based SVM Classifier for biometric authentication system, allows to select specific area from whole object, extract features from specific area of object leads reduction in processing time and complexity in feature extraction. Later the system recognises respective faces, finally it checks for live objects with the help of Fuzzy logic based SVM classifier. With these proposed Face and liveness Detection with Combined Feature Descriptors using Fuzzy based SVM Classifier for biometric authentication system makes it practical to train well performed individual Object to its certain face with liveness detection and got improvement in performance and accuracy. © 2017, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

AB In the domain of smart homes, technologies for personal safety and security play a prominent role. This paper presents a low-complexity Android application designed for mobile and embedded devices, that exploits the on-board camera to easily capture two images of the subject, and processes them to discriminate a true 3D and live face from a 2D one. The liveness detection based on such a discrimination provides anti-spoofing capabilities to secure access control based on face recognition. The results obtained are satisfactory even in different ambient light conditions, and further improvements are being developed to deal with low precision image acquisition. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2017.

AB Face authentication is one of the most promising biometric-based user authentication mechanisms that have been widely available in this era of mobile computing. With built-in front cameras on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, face authentication provides an attractive alterna tive to the legacy passwords for its simplicity and memory-less authentication process. Nonetheless, existing face authentication systems are inherently vulnerable to the so-called media-based facial forgery (MFF) attacks in which adversaries use victims' photos/videos to circumvent face authen tication. The threat of MFF-based attacks becomes clear and present as numerous personal images and videos are made available online every day. In order to prevent such attacks, it is imperative to incorporate liveness detection mechanisms in face authentication systems. In this chapter, we provide a comprehensive overview of the latest development of liveness detection for face authen tication, with a focus on mobile platforms. We categorize existing liveness detection techniques based on the types of liveness indicators being employed and evaluate their performance in terms of effectiveness, practicability, and robustness. We also comment on the future of designing a reliable liveness detection mechanism for face authentication on mobile devices © 2017 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB Imposters gain unauthorized access to biometric recognition systems using fake biometric data of the legitimate user termed as spoofing. Spoofing of face recognition systems is done by photographs, 3D models and videos of the user. Attack video contains noise from the acquisition process. In this work, we use noise residual content of the video in order to detect spoofed videos. We take advantage of wavelet transform for representing the noise video. Samples of the noise video, termed as visual rhythm image is created for each video. Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and uniform Local Binary Pattern (LBPu2) are extracted from the visual rhythm image followed by classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM). Large size of video from which a number of frames are used for analysis results in huge execution timing. In this work the spoof detection algorithm is applied on various levels of subsections of the video frames resulting in reduced execution timing with reasonable detection accuracies.

AB Critical infrastructure faces changed landscape of threats which requires progress in the understanding of highly sophisticated attacks. A reflection of this awareness is the upcoming technical documentation of umbrella organizations in critical infrastructure. The attack modeling is an important approach in the design stage of the system. The attack tree is a structural technique for attack modeling. In terms of graphic presentation, attack trees are not complex and can be designed manually, also, they are an important tool in recognizing threats and evaluating risks. The absence of the presentation of comprehensive and systematic approaches to the attack modeling is often reflected in rather generalized and inconsistent presentations of the attack modeling as well as in difficult transfer of attack modeling techniques into practice. The current absence of the agreement and lack of consistency in the development approach of structural attack models limits the transfer of concepts in the field of cyber-attacks to educational environments. The purpose of the paper is to present, in clear practical example, a proposal for the development approach to the attack modeling. Thus, we want to contribute to the implementation of attack modeling into practice, especially in the field of cyber security education. © 2016 IEEE.

DE August Strindberg; Drama; Historicity; Ingmar Bergman; Liveness; Television;
AB This article examines Ingmar Bergman's first (and only) television adaptations of dramatist August Strindberg: The Storm (1960) and A Dream Play (1963). Both were broadcast live and favorably received by contemporary critics. A recurrent reaction was that television finally "did justice" to these plays from the early 20th century; implying, as did Raymond Williams in his 1974 book on television, that Strindberg's later drama somehow "anticipated" television. This claim is explored in relation to various thematic and formal expressions of temporality in both plays (motifs of enclosed spaces, telephones, clouds, and faces and the dialectics of progress and repetition) and the specificities of television (the "management of liveness," "mobile privatization," monitoring, etc.). The type of historicity involved in the claim that art may anticipate oncoming media technology is related to Walter Benjamin's notion of pre- and post-history. © 2016 Staffan Ericson.

TI Detecting sensor level spoof attacks using joint encoding of temporal

AB Automated detection of sensor level spoof attacks is critical for success of surveillance technologies and the detection of crimes. This paper presents a new approach to more accurately detect such spoof face presentation attempts during the surveillance. The image data from the spoof samples not only illustrates the subtle texture difference in the spatial domain but is also accompanied by temporal differences as compared to those from the live/real human samples. Therefore, we investigate a new approach to encode the sparsity of these two different categories while combining these two cues from the acquired image sequences. The spatial and temporal information in the acquired image data and the sparse dictionary approach are used to encode such information in effectively separating the spoof and the live categories. This approach does not require large number of training samples, such as for the deep learning based methods, while achieving very good performance. The experimental results presented in this paper on publicly available database achieve outperforming results and illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2016 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

AB An effective and efficient algorithm is proposed in this paper to distinguish the live face from fake face images in the bioinformatics authentication systems to improve the system reliability. By analyzing the spectrum distribution of the interested face region, fake faces which shown in LCD displays can be easily picked out from captured live faces.

AB While more accurate and reliable than ever, the trustworthiness of biometric verification systems is compromised by the emergence of spoofing attacks. Responding to this threat, numerous research publications address isolated spoofing detection, resulting in efficient counter-measures for many biometric modes. However, an important, but often overlooked issue regards their engagement into a verification task and how to measure their impact on the verification systems themselves. A novel evaluation framework for verification systems under spoofing attacks, called expected performance and spoofability framework, is the major contribution of this paper. Its purpose is to serve for an objective comparison of different verification systems with regards to their verification performance and vulnerability to spoofing, taking into account the system's application-dependent susceptibility to spoofing attacks and cost of the errors. The convenience of the proposed open-source framework is demonstrated for the face mode, by comparing the security guarantee of four baseline face verification systems before and after they are secured with antispoofing algorithms. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB Existing face recognition systems are susceptible to spoofing attacks. So, Face liveness detection is a pivotal part for reliable face recognition, which has recently acknowledged vast attention. In this paper we propose a wavelet decomposition based face liveness recognition system using an energy calculation technique. Live faces contain high energy components compared to fake or printed image. In this paper, we calculate energy components of live face as well as fake face using discrete wavelet decomposition method. We analyze percentage of energy at different levels as well as for different wavelet basis function. We also analyze percentage of energy at different RGB bands and efficient face liveness detection method has been proposed. Discrete wavelet representation has been used to calculate decomposed energy components. Moreover, it provides differentiation of several spatial orientations as well as average and detailed information which are missing in the fake faces. This technique provides excellent discrimination capability when compared to the previously reported works based on the discrete Fourier transform and n-dimensional Fourier transform operations. To verify the proposed approach, we tested the performance using various face antispoofing datasets such as university of south Alabama (UFAD), and MSU face antispoofing dataset which incorporates different types of attacks. The test results obtained using the proposed technique shows better performance compared to existing techniques. © 2016 SPIE.

AB In recent years, counterfeiting is posing a serious threat to face recognition based authentication system. Introducing liveness detection into a face-based authentication system can be a good solution to the problem. This paper applied eye region detection and tracking technology to anti-counterfeiting application, and designed an eye region activity based liveness detection system. First, a scale balance and a "face-to-eye" strategy were proposed to fast detect the eye region, and then KLT algorithm was used to track the detected eye region. At last, a random instruction (closing eye, moving to the left or right) was evoked to the user, and the liveness judgment was given according to the results of the users' cooperation. Experiments show that the proposed eye region activity based face liveness detection system is real-time and robust, and can meet the needs of practical applications. © 2016 SERSC.

AB Although biometric identification is widely known for its use in digital forensics, it is evolving and becoming seamlessly integrated into many technological gadgets to increase security by properly identifying a person as the owner. Identification based on biometrics aims to provide people with the assurance that their data is secure and safe, especially if they become the victim of cell phone theft or intrusion. This research project objective is to determine if the current (2014) generation of smartphones is susceptible to traditional biometric attacks. Past research has shown that biometric systems have been susceptible to spoofing - falsifying one’s identification as someone else in order to gain access. Due to the time frame provided for this experiment, the focus of our project is on the biometric systems in place on two same-generation smartphones: a Samsung Galaxy S5 and an HTC One M8. The two specific biometric systems tested were fingerprint recognition and facial recognition.

AB Use of Mobile devices and internet developed gradually into a ubiquitous network and web has taken an increasingly central role in our communication. Recently the emergence of intelligent, sophisticated attacks like DOS (Denial of Service) makes web services more vulnerable than ever. To handle the DOS attacks, CAPTCHAs are used as one of the standard security technology. CAPTCHAs generate grade tests that most humans can pass but current computer programs can't. Human users and automated scripts can be classified and CAPTCHA is one of the possible ways to classify them. Text based CAPTCHAs are used in many applications but they face a challenge due to language dependency. Dynamic image based CAPTCHAs can strength the robustness of CAPTCHAs. It improves the human success rate. The probability of a BOT hacking the system is considerably low as compared to existing text based CAPTCHA. In this paper, an image-based Avatar CAPTCHA for mobile devices has been proposed as a potential solution. The solution of CAPTCHA is that users must correctly identify visually distorted human faces embedded in a complex background without selecting any non-human Avatar face. With this proposed work, CAPTCHA service is hosted on cloud that will generate CAPTCHA on cloud, so it improves efficiency of CAPTCHA generation also reduces response time for the use to authenticate as human. The need for usability and presentation that is required for a mobile device is considered during implementation. The proposed algorithm generates a CAPTCHA that offers better accuracy and lower machine attack rates compared to existing approaches. © 2014 IEEE.

AB The identity of every human subject is imprinted in the subject's mind. This work explores one possible approach to authentication of the user identity using implicit long-term memory, specifically, memory for faces. New elements include social-emotional associated actions similar to episodic memories used in the training and authentication procedure. Also in contrast with related studies, the method is designed to defeat shoulder-surfing attacks: Even prolonged observation of the authentication procedure does not allow a third party to learn how to pass the challenge without special training. Potential applications, problems and ideas of alternative approaches arc discussed. © 2015, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelli gence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.

AB The security of the face recognition technology has attracted more and more attention because of the wide applications of this technology. A lot of studies on face liveness detection have been performed. In this paper, we cast the face liveness detection problem as a classification problem to distinguish the images of true faces and photo samples based on the rank analysis of sample matrices. We assume that the rank of the true face sample matrix is much higher than that of the photo sample matrix under an ideal situation. If we denoise the real world samples and convert them into pure samples, we can find a well boundary, that is, a basis for liveness detection. Experiments are conducted on the NUAA imposter database to verify the efficiency of the proposed method. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB Biometric systems by design find out or confirm a person's identity based on his anatomical and behavioural features like fingerprint, face, iris, voice and gait and these traits cannot be easily lost or forgotten or distributed or forged. Since biometric systems need the user to be in attendance at the time of proving identity, it can also daunt users from making false denial claims. In this paper, software-based fake detection method that can be used in multiple biometric systems to detect different types of fraudulent access attempts is proposed. The objective of the proposed system is to enhance the security of biometric identification frameworks, by adding liveness evaluation in a fast, user-friendly, and no trespassing manner, through the use of image quality assessment. The technique consists of two phases namely, feature extraction phase and classification phase. In feature extraction phase, the features amounting to 25 of them are extracted. It includes full reference based features and no reference based features. Subsequently, classification based on these features is carried out by the trained PSO classifier. The proposed technique will be applied to Iris, Fingerprint and Face Recognition. © Research India Publications.

AB Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a rare inheritable disorder of connective tissue. While musculoskeletal abnormalities are well known, cardiovascular involvement is rare. Aortic root dilation is the most common cardiovascular manifestation. OI preferentially affects the left-sided heart valves, for unclear reasons, leading to aortic and mitral regurgitation. Valve replacement surgery carries a unique set of issues in this population, and fewer than 40 cases have been reported. We report a case of chronic severe aortic regurgitation in a patient with OI complicated by the development of a flail aortic valve leaflet and presenting with a transient ischemic attack. The patient subsequently underwent successful combined bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting. We review the literature on valvular disease and other cardiovascular manifestations in OI and the related surgical considerations relevant to this patient population. © 2009, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Gob Squad's Act of Rebellion - Revolution Now!

DE Audience participation; Gob Squad; Liveness; Mediatisation; Political theatre; Revolution Now!;
AB With its recent production Revolution Now! (2010) the English-German performance collective Gob Squad tackles “the current mood of disengagement” of contemporary theatre as identified by Kritzer (218) and attempts to stir up a revolution by involving the audience and unwitting passers-by outside the theatrical venue as amateur revolutionaries. Yet the production neither adheres to a concrete political ideology, nor does it further specify the cause of discontent or the need for a revolution. Although it turns out that the public, 'The People,' is hardly ready for this improvised revolution, Gob Squad manage to unite performers, audience and passers-by in a temporary community that pursues the single goal of finding a member of the public who is willing to instigate the revolution. This is achieved primarily via the excessive use of mediatisation that connects stage, auditorium and the streets outside the venue by means of two-way live transmissions. The onstage revolution is thus projected into the 'reality' beyond the stage and the theatre whereas 'reality' is simultaneously framed and becomes part of the action on the stage. In the end, it remains questionable whether the revolution actually reaches 'the masses' or whether revolutionary activism is to be seen as an absurd or ineffectual performance that is moreover manipulated and distorted by its mediatisation. More striking is the sense of immediacy and authenticity evoked despite the mediatisation and overt theatricality as well as the feeling of individual responsibility for the performance. Since the spectators have to face themselves as projected onto the screens on the stage - in the roles of sceptics, passive observers or active revolutionaries - it becomes impossible for them to remain detached. In this sense, Gob Squad explore a new form of theatre able to challenge political disengagement by combining the immediacy of liveness with the inescapability of mediatisation. © 2014 De Gruyter.

AB Due to the fact that face recognition is likely to suffer from spoofing attempt from printed images or high-quality digital images, secure identification is an urgent issue to be addressed. Given this problem, we present a non-intrusive solution based on a single image, which works well either with printed images or images displayed on a laptop screen. In the proposed method, the anti-spoofing is taken as a binary classification problem. The singular value and histogram of HSV color space are exploited for feature extraction. Afterwards, SVM classifier is utilized to determine whether the captured face image conform to a live face or not. Extensive experiment results show that the proposed method gained a real nice performance on available databases. © 2014 Binary Information Press.

AB Due to its several advantages including practicality and simple requirements, facial identification has attracted a great amount of attention over the past years. Nonetheless, several studies have investigated the vulnerabilities a face biometrics system might face. Therefore, many researches are investigating the countermeasures to these spoof attempts. Unlike passive authentication methods that were profoundly studied, interaction was broadly examined as a potential robust spoofing prevention approach. In this paper, we present our collected dataset, propose an interactive authentication method, evaluate and compare its robustness to the best known static anti-spoofing detection approach under realistic conditions. © (2014) by Society of Digital Information and Wireless Communication (SDIWC).

AB Nowadays, bad adaptive performance of network intrusion prevention becomes the bottleneck of its development in face of complex and volatile attacks. The idea of cognitive network intrusion prevention is creatively put forward to solve the problem in this paper. According to the cognitive requirements, three basic problems for cognitive IPS are presented, which are knowledge representation, environmental perception, and self-learning. For problem one, ontology-based knowledge presentation is adopted in order to meet the need of semantic and the procedure for producing domain ontology is given. For problem two, the logical structure of security environmental perception is shown. For problem three, a new method of self-learning based on internal feedback from unexpected failure is proposed. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.

TI Malignant glaucoma (posterior aqueous diversion syndrome)
SO Clinical Glaucoma Care: The Essentials
LA English
DT CHAP
AB The term malignant glaucoma has been used historically to describe a devastating and unusual form of glaucoma that occurred following ocular surgery. The current definition has been expanded to include classic malignant glaucoma and nonphakic malignant glaucoma as well as disorders occurring in other clinical situations. Classic malignant glaucoma is usually associated with a specific clinical scenario that occurs after incisional surgery (iridectomy or filtration) for primary angle-closure glaucoma, secondary or chronic angle-closure glaucoma, or at times open-angle glaucoma in phakic patients. The occurrence of malignant glaucoma after cataract surgery and the persistence of malignant glaucoma following cataract surgery in the classic form have been termed as aphakic malignant glaucoma. The diagnosis nonphakic malignant glaucoma has been suggested for both aphakic and pseudophakic types and may also be applied to the development of malignant glaucoma after combined cataract and filtration surgery. The term malignant-like glaucoma has been proposed for instances with similar clinical presentations but where different underlying pathophysiology may be present. The pathognomonic findings of classic malignant glaucoma are increased IOP or unexpected normal IOP following glaucoma surgery, central (axial) shortening of the anterior chamber, open iridotomy or iridectomy, and no evidence for choroidal effusion or hemorrhage. Classic malignant glaucoma typically develops after surgical peripheral iridectomy or filtering (full-thickness sclerectomy or trabeculectomy) surgery in phakic patients. Two clinical cases discussed here are illustrative of classic malignant glaucoma presentations. Malignant glaucoma in aphakia is a term for eyes with persistence of preexisting malignant glaucoma after cataract surgery as well as in patients with malignant glaucoma occurring following routine cataract surgery. Malignant glaucoma has also been reported following Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy, diode laser cyclocoagulation, and aqueous tube shunt surgery. Numerous clinical entities share some or all the findings of classic phakic and nonphakic malignant glaucoma. The presence of diagnostic criteria and the response to treatment distinguish between malignant glaucoma and malignant-like glaucoma. The clinical findings in malignant glaucoma and its various presentations previously have been thought to be primarily the end result of aqueous misdirection or posterior aqueous diversion. Mechanisms that involve various contributions of the lens or zonules, ciliary processes, anterior hyaloid face, or vitreous body have been proposed. Malignant glaucoma would result from a persistent expansion of the vitreous volume in an eye with a relatively impermeable and dimini

DE Face recognition; Mask attack; Presentation attack; Spoofing; Uncertainty;
AB Data uncertainty in face recognition due to various environmental factors and spoofing face recognition with 3D- masks are two major threats to gain illegitimate access. A single image of face has got high uncertainty in representing the face since the face image varies with illumination, facial expression and pose. Thus a face image can only be considered as an observation but not an absolute accurate representation of the face. The accuracy of the face recognition can be improved by obtaining more face images from the same person. However in real-world we only have a limited number of available face images and thus there is high uncertainty. In this paper, we attempt to reduce the uncertainty of face image by synthesizing the virtual training samples. Similarly, spoofing is the act of gaining an illegitimate access by masquerading as a valid user by falsifying data. Among all biometric traits, face can be exposed to the most serious threats as it is easy to access and reproduce. In this paper various spoofing techniques have been have been examined and different algorithms have been put forward to detect them. We try to examine the spoofing potential of 3D facial masks for different recognition systems and address the detection problem for this complex attack. © 2014 IEEE.

TI Spoofing attempt detection using gaze colocation

DE Biometric systems; Co-located; Colocations; Display screen; Face liveness; Liveness; Spoofing attacks; Visual stimulus; Biometrics;
AB Spoofing attacks on biometric systems are one of the major impediments to their use for secure unattended applications. This paper presents a novel method for face liveness detection by tracking the gaze of the user with an ordinary webcam. In the proposed system, an object appears randomly on the display screen which the user is required to look at while their gaze is measured. The visual stimulus appears in such a way that it repeatedly directs the gaze of the user to specific points on the screen. Features extracted from images captured at these sets of colocated points are used to estimate the liveness of the user. A scenario is investigated where genuine users track the challenge with head/eye movements whereas the impostors hold a photograph of the target user and attempt to follow the stimulus during simulated spoofing attacks. The results from the experiments indicate the effectiveness of the gaze colocation feature in detecting spoofing attack. © 2013 Gesellschaft für Informatik e.V. (GI).

AB The McEliece public key cryptosystem (PKC) is regarded as secure in the presence of quantum computers because no efficient quantum algorithm is known for the underlying problems, which this cryptosystem is built upon. As we show in this paper, a straightforward implementation of this system may feature several side channels. Specifically, we present a Timing Attack which was executed successfully against a software implementation of the McEliece PKC. Furthermore, the critical system components for key generation and decryption are inspected to identify channels enabling power and cache attacks. Implementation aspects are proposed as countermeasures to face these attacks. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

AB Earthen embankments, such as dams or levees, are a potential target for explosive attacks. Attack scenarios include large vehicle-borne charges (truck bombs) detonated on a roadway located along the embankment crest and large vessel-borne charges positioned close to the upstream face (dam) or river side slope (levee) of the embankment. Such attacks could disturb the material in a levee or dam enough to produce breaches. Computer simulations of such attack scenarios provide data to develop simplified methods for rapidly estimating damage. This requires the development and validation of first-principle numerical codes and constitutive models to accurately simulate the damage zones produced by detonation of large explosive charges in close proximity to earthen embankments. These simulations are extremely useful for providing insights into the mechanics of damage formation. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is conducting a research program to estimate the damage to levees from explosive attack. As part of this effort, numerical simulations were conducted to identify and investigate the performance of several levee designs subjected to explosive attack scenarios. The presentation provides a summary of the numerical simulation effort. © (2012) by Association of State Dam Safety Officials All rights reserved.

AB The model of concurrent system is the research foundation of its performance evaluation, simulation, scheduling and control. Mutex is one of the most important features of concurrent. systems.This paper establishes a general mathematical model-Mutex-Model for exclusive systems. Decomposes the mutex property of concurrent system into safety, liveness and non-blocking and translates these features into LTL formulas formal specification. Gives a model checking algorithm based on fixed-point theory for Mutex-Model. And then combines with an example, the paper formally verifies the Mutex-Model Gives the explicit refinement and improvement of the model. As concurrent system's processes increase, this model checking algorithm have to face state explosion problem. So the paper gives another symbolic model checking algorithm based on BDD and Boolean formulas. This algorithm is simple and efficient, and effectively alleviate the state explosion problem.

AB Verification of distributed system protocols either suffers from state-space explosion in composing the combined behavior of a number of identical participating processes or lacs in automated theorem proving technique to handle it. HS leader election protocol in a bidirectional synchronous ring is one such distributed system protocol whose verification also faces the same difficulties. A new mechanized verification framework proposed recently by the authors combines the tableau based theorem proving approach and model checking. It claims to have addressed the issues. In this paper authors have used this framework to verify the liveness property of HS Leader Election Protocol in a bidirectional synchronous ring to show that it can be effectively mechanized. © 2012 IEEE.

AB Biometrics is a rapidly developing technology that is to identify a person based on his or her physiological or behavioral characteristics. To ensure the correction of authentication, the biometric system must be able to detect and reject the use of a copy of a biometric instead of the live biometric. This function is usually termed "liveness detection". This paper describes a new method for live face detection. Using structure and movement information of live face, an effective live face detection algorithm is presented. Compared to existing approaches, which concentrate on the measurement of 3D depth information, this method is based on the analysis of Fourier spectra of a single face image or face image sequences. Experimental results show that the proposed method has an encouraging performance.

AB A 63-year-old woman is referred for neurologic consultation because of electrical shocks of pain in a left V3 distribution. The attacks are very brief, but occur many times a day, triggered by cold, touch, and chewing. In between attacks, she is pain free. Her neurologic examination is normal. This straightforward presentation of trigeminal neuralgia leaves the consulting neurologist wondering what to do with the other 45 minutes of the visit. The current article is vignette-based and deals with patients who may not fit into such a neat category. It is meant for the general neurologist, not the headache specialist. Aside from routine scenarios, it includes discussions of atypical facial pain, temporo-mandibular joint disorder, burning mouth syndrome, and other vexing types of facial pain.

DE Gen 48:22; House and allotment of Joseph; inheritance of Canaan; Jubilees 34; Shechem;
AB This paper analyses Jub. 34:1-9, an extra-biblical account of Jacob and his sons warring against the Amorites. Herein, the Jubilean author portrays Joseph as an exemplary family man who assists his brothers in fighting for and occupying the allotment of Ephraim and Manasseh. While Joseph's portrayal corresponds to the favorable presentation of the patriarchs in Jubilees, it also highlights Israelite solidarity in the face of an enemy attack. Enhancing Jacob-Israel's military prowess, this unity leads the Israelites to victory and thus to inheritance of the land. While these themes appear apposite to the Maccabean period in general, the pericope does not reflect a historical military campaign. © 2012 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.

AB The global reliance on computers, networks and systems continues to grow. As our dependency grows so do the threats that target our military C4ISR (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance), as well as the operational components and electronic controls for our critical infrastructure. During our collaborative research one individual proclaimed it C8ISR. (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Combat systems, Collaboration, Coordination, Code, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) Given the U.S. military is the most modern, computerized force in the world, the challenge of cyber defense is far greater than for any other military in the world. Over the past decade we have experienced a substantial rise in the complexity and sophistication of cyber attacks, as well as a frightening increase in the impact of some of the attacks. Every computer is a potential cyber weapon waiting to be loaded and used by extremists, criminals, terrorists and rogue nation states. As the world becomes more and more dependent on computers and information technology, the greater the risk of cyber attacks. Government and military leaders now face this fact and our critical systems and infrastructure remain at great risk! This risk has made the ability to defend these critical systems and wage cyber attacks core capabilities required for the modern military. In the age of cyber conflict, leaders need to understand the weapons and strategies used to wage this rapidly evolving type of warfare. Public and private cooperation is not critical, it is essential if these threats are going to be addressed and proper safeguards put in place to protect the critical infrastructure from increasingly hostile cyber attacks. The realities associated with the threat of cyber conflict are beginning to set in after the attacks on Estonia, Georgia and Kyrgyzstan. The recent attacks over the July 4th holiday on the United States and South Korea have reinforced the need for immediate action and part of that action is education. Cyber warfare is now viewed as a component of a comprehensive national security strategy rather than a standalone option. It is paramount that the military, intelligence agencies, government leaders, and the homeland security community develop an appropriate doctrine to systematically and appropriately counter the threat of cyber terrorism and cyber warfare. This presentation is designed to introduce participants to the current threat environment and the current state of cyber vulnerabilities, cyber weapons and a framework for addressing cyber weapons.

AB A novel TIR/VIS cross-modality model is presented. It has a live signature and is illumination invariant for the thermal infrared spectrum. It can be used to solve several difficult problems in face biometrics, e.g. face recognition under weak illumination while lacking a thermal infrared face template of enrollment, liveness assurance against photograph and video face spoofing, face disguise identification, etc. In the presented approach, correlative subspace for TIR/VIS cross-modality is learned by canonical correlation analysis and correlation coefficients between TIR and VIS face variables on different face patches are presented by leave-one-out cross-validation. The experiment results show that it is effective to model TIR/VIS cross-modality using canonical correlation analysis via patch correlation coefficient based weighting. © 2011 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

AB In this paper, a novel fake detection approach is presented for biometric face recognition systems using background analysis. More specifically, a probabilistic approach is presented to combine evidences obtained from the background and foreground regions. First, the location of a face is detected by the Adaboost algorithm. Second, the background region, i.e., a region without the face and upper body, is extracted based on the extracted face region. Third, the liveness of current face video can be decided by comparing the similarity of current background region and the original background region that was stored at the initializing stage, and by analyzing the motion of the background region. Lastly, a probability network is used to combine evidences obtained from the background and foreground regions, calculating the probability of the liveness of the current face video.

AB A specific form of large subcortical hemispheric infarction on computed tomography was identified in 24 of 2198 (1%) stroke registry patients. Combined with 13 cases from earlier literature reports, a characteristic neurologic picture developed. Severe face plus arm plus leg weakness at onset (76%), corticallike features of aphasia and/or contralateral neglect (68%), and premonitory transient ischemic attacks (24%) were frequent. Twenty-two patients (59%) had large vessel arterial occlusive disease. Eight patients (22%) had primary embolic occlusion in the middle cerebral artery territory. During an average follow-up of 16 months, five patients (14%) suffered recurrent stroke or death. The clinical presentation and prognostic features of this distinct stroke subtype are described. © 1988, American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

TI Tolosa-Hunt syndrome and cavernous sinus thrombosis as a complication

AB Objectives: Cavernous sinus thrombosis is most commonly a late complication of an infection of the central face or paranasal sinuses. It is generally a fulminant process with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it needs immediate treatment. Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is a rare but not a fatal disorder caused by non-specific inflammation of the cavernous sinus or superior orbital fissure. Since both of these conditions affect the cavernous sinus and nearby structures, they have quite similar presentations. Our objective is to highlight the difficulty in differentiating these two conditions. Case Report: We report the case of a 34-year-old Malay lady who presented with history of frontal headache for two weeks followed by diplopia, unable to lift the left eye lid and projectile vomiting. On examination, she has complete ptosis with reduced vision (6/36) and restricted movement of the eye ball (3rd, 4th and 6th nerve palsies) of her left eye. Nasoendoscopy revealed pus in the left nasopharynx posterior to eustachian tube opening. CT scan revealed engorgement of the left cavernous sinus which showed enhancement post contrast injection. Mucosal thickening was seen within the left sphenoidal sinus. These features are in keeping with left cavernous sinus thrombosis, as a complication of sphenoidal sinusitis. She has been treated accordingly. On reviewing the patient, we found that she actually has three episodes of similar problem during the last five years which were resolved itself. In view of her clinical courses with the current clinical findings, this patient has been diagnosed as Tolosa-Hunt syndrome. The lesion in the CT scan was actually an inflammatory lesion. Discussion: Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome is a painful ophthalmoplegia caused by nonspecific inflammation of the cavernous sinus or superior orbital fissure 1,2,3). This disorder is uncommon. Similar presentations of impaired ocular motility, ptosis and impaired vision are known to occur in cavernous sinus thrombosis4,5). It is also not a common condition. The history of similar attacks for a few times makes the diagnosis of Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome more likely. Relapses can be ipsilateral, contralateral or bilateral. It is a self limited disease1,3). However, corticosteroids lessen the degree and duration of the symptoms1,6,7). Conclusion: Cavernous sinus thrombosis and Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome are partly sharing the same clinical presentations. High suspicion of a more fatal disease sometimes is very important for the sake of the patient. © 2009 Japan International Cultural Exchange Foundation.

AB Facial flushing attacks as a Carcinoid syndrome are quite a rare presentation in pulmonary tumorlets and bronchiectasis. We experienced a case in which a 43-year-old woman with bronchiectasis presented to our department with continuous facial flushing attacks for 3 years in the absence of bronchiectasis symptom. Computed tomographic scans revealed bronchiectasis of the left lower lobe and no tumor. A left lower lobectomy was performed, and multiple tumorlets were observed on microscopic examination among the bronchiectasis. Histologic and immunohistochemical examination revealed findings consistent with diffuse tumorlets and bronchiectasis in the lung. © 2009 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

AB In this paper we propose a robust audio-visual speech-and-speaker recognition system with liveness checks based on audio-visual fusion of audio-lip motion and depth features. The liveness verification feature added here guards the system against advanced spoofing attempts such as manufactured or replayed videos. For visual features, a new tensor-based representation of lip motion features, extracted from an intensity and depth subspace of 3D video sequences, is fused used with the audio features. A multilevel fusion paradigm involving first a Support Vector Machine for speech (digit) recognition and then a Gaussian Mixture Model for speaker verification with liveness checks allowed a significant performance improvement over single-mode features. Experimental evaluation for different scenarios with AVOZES, a 3D stereovision speaking-face database, shows favourable results with recognition accuracies of 70-90% for the digit recognition task, and EERs of 5% and 3% for the speaker verification and liveness check tasks respectively.

AB Multi-stream interactive systems can be seen as "hidden adversary" systems (HAS), where the observable behaviour on any interaction channel is affected by interactions happening on other channels. One way of modelling HAS is in the form of a multi-process I/O automata, where each interacting process appears as a token in a shared state space. Constraints in the state space specify how the dynamics of one process affects other processes. We define the "liveness criterion" of each process as the end objective to be achieved by the process. The problem now for each process is to achieve this objective in the face of unforeseen interferences from other processes. In an earlier paper, it was proposed that this uncertainty can be mitigated by collaboration among the disparate processes. Two types of collaboration philosophies were also suggested: altruistic collaboration and pragmatic collaboration. This paper addresses the HAS validation problem where processes collaborate altruistically. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB More than 60 years ago A. Freud and T. Bergman described the psychological repercussions of childhood illness and demonstrated that illness, hospitalization and surgery are potentially traumatic experiences for the mind of the child. This article demonstrate how children who face surgery are more exposed to psychological trauma than adults due to their relatively immature mental apparatus. The major contribution of the article is presentation of the psychological aspects of the illness and child's view to the operation as a violent attack against his body integrity. The approach of Vidišč ák is accentuated.

AB The fluid dynamics of airflow through a city controls the transport and dispersion of airborne contaminants. This is urban aerodynamics, not meteorology. The average flow, large-scale fluctuations and turbulence are closely coupled to the building geometry. Buildings create large "rooster-tail" wakes; there are systematic fountain flows up the backs of tall buildings; and dust in the wind can move perpendicular to or even against the locally prevailing wind. Requirements for better prediction accuracy demand time-dependent, three-dimensional CFD computations that include solar heating and buoyancy, complete landscape and building geometry specification including foliage and, realistic wind fluctuations. This fundamental prediction capability is necessary to assess urban visibility and line-of-sight sensor performance in street canyons and rugged terrain. Computing urban aerodynamics accurately is clearly a time-dependent High Performance Computing (HPC) problem. In an emergency, on the other hand, prediction technology to assess crisis information, sensor performance, and obscured line-of-sight propagation in the face of industrial spills, transportation accidents, or terrorist attacks has very tight time requirements that suggest simple approximations which tend to produce inaccurate results. In the past we have had to choose one or the other: a fast, inaccurate model or a slow accurate model. Using new fluid-dynamic principles, an urban-oriented emergency assessment system called CT-Analyst□ was invented that solves this dilemma. It produces HPC-quality results for airborne contaminant scenarios nearly instantly and has unique new capabilities suited to sensor optimization. This presentation treats the design and use of CT-Analyst and discusses the developments needed for widespread use with advanced sensor and communication systems.

AB Biometric systems, such as face tracking and recognition, are increasingly being used as a means of security in many areas. The usability of these systems depend not only on how accurate they are in terms of detection and recognition but also on how well they withstand attacks. In this paper we developed a text-driven face-video signal from the XM2VTS database. The synthesized video can be used as a means of playback attack for face detection and recognition systems. We use Hidden Markov Model to recognize the speech of a person and use the transcription file for reshuffling the image sequences as per the prompted text. The discontinuities in the new video are significantly minimized by using a pyramid based multi-resolution frame interpolation technique. The playback can also be used to test liveness detection systems that rely on lip-motion to speech synchronization and motion of the head while posing/speaking. Finally we suggest possible approaches to enable biometric systems to stand against this kind of attacks. Other uses of our results include web-based video communication for electronic commerce. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

AB A face-spoofing attack occurs when an imposter manipulates a face recognition and verification system to gain access as a legitimate user by presenting a 2D printed image or recorded video to the face sensor. This paper presents an efficient and non-intrusive method to counter face-spoofing attacks that uses a single image to detect spoofing attacks. We apply a nonlinear diffusion based on an additive operator splitting scheme. Additionally, we propose a specialized deep convolution neural network that can extract the discriminative and high-level features of the input diffused image to differentiate between a fake face and a real face. Our proposed method is both efficient and convenient compared with the previously implemented state-of-the-art methods described in the literature review. We achieved the highest reported accuracy of 99% on the widely used NUAA dataset. In addition, we tested our method on the Replay Attack dataset which consists of 1200 short videos of both real access and spoofing attacks. An extensive experimental analysis was conducted that demonstrated better results when compared to previous static algorithms results. However, this result can be improved by applying a sparse autoencoder learning algorithm to obtain a more distinguishable diffused image. © 2016, Springer-Verlag London.

AB As a key component of the American health care system, the physician office could be the front line in a bioterrorist attack. Nationally and locally, the primary focus on this subject appears to be from a hospital preparedness and public health agency perspective, with little attention devoted to primary physician providers in their own offices, and those specialists to whom patients may be referred. While unrelated to bioterrorism, the recent SARS outbreak also brings to the forefront the need for physicians offices to be able to clinically, operationally, and managerially respond to illnesses that mirror the symptoms of known illnesses, but may be more virulent new organisms or hybrids of existing organisms. If the face of bioterrorism is subtle and slow in its presentation, physicians, in their own offices, could be the first providers of care. Will they be prepared, or will they be among the first fatalities in a bioterrorist attack? © 2004.

AB Europe's low-cost airline sector is proving to be as vulnerable to economic travails as the full-service operators. Since the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, sixty airlines have filed for bankruptcy or have disappeared. Low-cost offshoots or full-fare airlines could face a challenging task in breaking free of traditional maintenance models based around in-house engineering. Low-cost carriers' direct maintenance costs are per flight mile could be as much as 40% lower than those of a traditional operator, with the main factor being the very high utilization rate targeted by the low-cost airlines.

AB Data security attacks are beginning to have a significant impact on a company's bottom line. But while most infringements have impacted the office environment, the evolution from proprietary to open-system architectures - and the increased use of wireless technology - is introducing the industrial sector to similar risks. That's because as companies evolve toward e-manufacturing, today's plants are becoming more integrated. The reasoning is simple. The tighter the connection between each application, the more information can be shared, collected and analyzed. As data from the factory floor becomes more important for real-time business decisions, end users need to take the proper steps to secure this data. This presentation will explore the security threats manufacturers currently face. And it will detail how a company can identify its key assets, develop an appropriate defense and patch existing holes to leverage the benefits an integrated facility. In particular, the presentation will focus on deploying wireless solutions in an industrial environment.

AB The childhood dermatomyositis is much less frequently seen than in the adult, and infantile form is more rare. It differs in many respects from the adult form of the disease. One of them is pathological features primarily involved in the small intramuscular blood vessels. This is a presentation of the infantile form exceptionally dystrophic dominant pattern in muscle biopsy. The patient is a 1-year-1-month-old girl who had been in good health and development until 9 months of age, when mother noted dusky erythematous discoloration of face and limbs. They were getting worse to skin ulcerations which fairly responded to topical corticosteroid. Because of gradual weakness, regression of motor development, anorexia, low grade fever and relapsing skin lesions, she was admitted to the SLH. Physical examinations revealed heliotrope eyelids, dusky erythematous or hyperpigmented skin with ulcers in the face, limbs and trunks. Muscle weakness is generalized, more involved in the proximal muscles so that she could not crawl and sit up alone. Lab shows; ESR 25 mm/hr, CRP-negative, GOT 118 u, GPT 36 u, LDH 1,270 u, ALD 19 u, CPK 1,104 u, Muscle biopsy shows minimum infiltration of mononuclear cells to the intramuscular vessels and moderate to severe dystrophic changes of muscle fibers. Three weeks treatment with 2 mg/kg of oral prednisolone is dramatic with rapid improvement of muscle weakness, muscle enzymes and skin manifestations. But skin manifestations are relapsing on tapering prednisolone. Characteristic vasculitis in the muscle biopsy of childhood dermatomyositis is rather scarce in our case. Instead, dystrophic changes are main features. Whether these findings are due to immunological immaturations or different mechanisms is unknown, yet the possibility of the direct attack to muscle fiber itself or membrane should be in mind as a pathogenesis of the illness. © 1984, The Japanese Society of Child Neurology.

AB OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the pattern of dog bites seen at the emergency department of a university hospital. The information will be used to plan prevention and enhance management strategies. METHODS: All patients (younger than 22 years) assessed at the emergency department between January 2003 and December 2004 with a discharge diagnosis of animal bites were identified through the computerized discharge network. RESULTS: One hundred forty-four incidents of animal bites (82 males and 62 females) occurred over the 2-year period. Eighty-nine percent was due to dog bites. Among the dog bite victims, the mean age was 11.82 years (SD, 6.39 years; range, 0.06-21.83 years). Family dogs were only involved in 15% of cases. The species of dogs were not recognized in three fifths, and attacks provoked in two fifths of victims. Most bites (90%) of bites involved only single anatomical sites. The extremities were commonly involved (right upper limb [23%], left upper limb [16%], right lower limb [35%], left lower limb [20%]). Torso (4%) and genitalia (0.8%) were uncommonly involved. Pain, erythema, bleeding, and bruising were common symptoms, but 60 patients were asymptomatic at presentation. Compared with older patients, children younger than 10 years had a much higher risk of facial injuries (25% vs. 2%, P = 0.0002; odds ratio, 21.8, 95% confidence interval, 2.9-455.9) and were more likely to be triaged as being urgent (P = 0.01). Most attacks were trivial and did not require hospitalization. Antirabies treatment was given in approximately half, analgesics in two fifths, and antibiotics in one fourth. CONCLUSIONS: In mammalian attacks, canines are most commonly involved. Most injuries are trivial, and the limbs are usually involved. However, younger children are at higher risk of facial injuries. Extent of pain and adverse psychological impacts are typically not documented in the emergency assessment. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB M. B. Delapalme, Elf‐Aquitaine, President de la Task Force 76', concluded that for industry to prepare the future rather than to have one thrust upon it, it was important to understand all the data, and detect the main currents before any solutions could be envisaged. Naturally, in this conference, it was never expected to resolve our outstanding queries, and the principal trend (apart from the universally high quality of the speeches) was the widening of a dialogue with outside bodies. The conference heard how IRI had invited company presidents to a meeting. Here ElRMA too has begun to develop contact with more ‘external forces’, economists, union leaders, consumers, members of governments. Sometimes our guests have shocked or surprised us, but that contact is vital. That the Director of the French National Institute of Consumers should declare his interest in establishing some sort of formal relationship with representatives of industrial research seems very desirable. From the germ of this idea may grow the basis of a future situation in which industry may no longer have to face unexpected attacks which in the end are destructive for all the parties involved. It seems fundamental to know what the principal powers that be in our countries expect of industrial research—even if as members one may not agree with them. It is certainly necessary that we are informed of their views. In particular, M. d'Ornano expressed an idea which seemed particularly interesting—that the research manager can and must play a part as intermediary or interpreter of research to production and vice versa—two different worlds of misunderstanding. For the things which remain to be done, it seems vital to get the proceedings of this conference published and put before a wide audience—many presentations being clearly destined to become reference papers for the future.

TI Static and dynamic orthodontics

DT JOUR
AB The dynamic nature of our specialty is a constant source of study to all of us as practitioners. We search unceasingly for methods and means of predicting, utilizing, or avoiding factors of human growth and development, particularly in the face and cranium. In this never-ending quest we employ static evidence to compile a dynamic record. Growth and development are self-implied dynamics, and our studies of them also have been dynamic. We have left no stone unturned, no cephalometric exposure untaken, in our desire to implement our diagnosis or treatment planning. It is expedient at this point in our specialty's evolution and development to consider the role of dynamics or function in the production of our final goal of "straight teeth". What has been presented is in no way an excuse for poor orthodontic mechanics; for all of the occlusal grinding possible, we cannot replace the need for sound and practical orthodontics. Occlusal adjustment before, during, or after orthodontic treatment should not be the indolent man's appliance. It is merely a way to achieve a more harmonious occlusal relation, in function, which enhances the totality of the original and purposive orthodontic treatment. What has been presented here is not new. All orthodontists have observed these things and have practiced a philosophy which in most instances encompasses the concept of function. What I have presented here represents merely a possible physiologic background for the how and the why of this concept. Orthodontics at the present time is accelerating at a rapid pace to meet all of the many and varied problems that are encountered each day in our practices. The ultimate solution to our problem is not found in a single concept, in a single set of dictums, nor in the mind and teaching of one man; rather, we will find that the multiplicity of our problems requires a multipronged attack by many men, many concepts, and many dictums. If but one thought from this presentation remains with you, I hope and trust that all of you will remember that the teeth are primarily for function in speech, deglutition, and mastication and that in recognition of this we must pursue a course of treatment which improves not only esthetics but function as well. © 1962.

AB The chief interest lay in the question whether operation could have been successfully performed. The patient, a man of fifty three, seen in consultation with Dr. Phippun, of Salem, was well apparently up to within six months of death, when appeared indisposition, indifference, and lack of ability to figure—symptoms hinted at for, perhaps, six months previously, but not interfering with work. Epileptiform attacks with loss of speech and twitching of right face with curious sensation in throat removed, and toward the end general convulsions. Right hemiplegia and right hemianopsia Came on about one month before death, with and double optic neuritis. Pupils were unaffected. There appeared to be numbness of right hand. The superficial reflexes were impaired on the sight. Intelligence was apparently good, the aphasia and agraphia were marked. Autopsy showed a tumor, apparently glioma, having a round surface, in the angle between Rolandic and Sylvian fissures, two by one and one-half inches, quite sharply defined. Vertical section showed extension inward about one inch with fairly distinct line of demascation, but no capsule. The tumor extended forward under the healthy cortex to a point beyond the transverse frontal sulcus. Microscopical examination to be reported later. © Williams & Wilkins 1895. All Rights Reserved.

AB We present 3 cases of hemiageusia due to focal ischemic lesions in the brainstem. Clinical presentation with discrete localization of these lesions suggests that the central taste pathway in humans projects ipsilaterally from the solitary nucleus up to the level of the upper pontine or lower midbrain before decussation. Associated partial sensory disturbance of the face or limb with lack of evidence of medial lemniscus decussation at the upper brainstem suggests that the medial lemniscus may not directly convey taste sensation.

AB In this paper, a new face anti-spoofing approach, which is based on analysis of contrast and texture characteristics of captured and recaptured images, is proposed to detect photograph spoofing. Since photo image is a recaptured image, it may show quite different contrast and texture characteristics when compared to a real face image. In a spoofing attempt, image rotation is quite possible. Therefore, in this paper, a rotation invariant local binary pattern variance (LBPV) based method is selected to be used. The approach is tested on the publicly available NUAA photo-impostor database, which is constructed under illumination and place change. The results show that the approach is competitive with other existing methods tested on the same database. It is especially useful for conditions when photos are held by hand to spoof the system. Since an LBPV based method is used, it is robust to illumination changes. It is non-intrusive and simple. © 2012 IEEE.

The proposed MLLV framework based on novel feature extraction and multimodal fusion approaches, uncovers the static and dynamic relationship between voice and face information from speaking faces, and allows multiple levels of security. Experiments with three different speaking corpora VidTIMIT, UCBN and A VOZES shows a significant improvement in system performance in terms of DET curves and equal error rates(EER) for different types of replay and synthesis attacks. © 2006 IEEE.

AB Face biometric systems are vulnerable to spoofing attacks. Such attacks can be performed in many ways, including presenting a falsified image, video or 3D mask of a valid user. A widely used approach for differentiating genuine faces from fake ones has been to capture their inherent differences in (2D or 3D) texture using local descriptors. One limitation of these methods is that they may fail if an unseen attack type, e.g. a highly realistic 3D mask which resembles real skin texture, is used in spoofing. Here we propose a robust anti-spoofing method by detecting pulse from face videos. Based on the fact that a pulse signal exists in a real living face but not in any mask or print material, the method could be a generalized solution for face liveness detection. The proposed method is evaluated first on a 3D mask spoofing database 3DMAD to demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting 3D mask attacks. More importantly, our cross-database experiment with high quality REAL-F masks shows that the pulse based method is able to detect even the previously unseen mask type whereas texture based methods fail to generalize beyond the development data. Finally, we propose a robust cascade system combining two complementary attack-specific spoof detectors, i.e. utilize pulse detection against print attacks and color texture analysis against video attacks. © 2016 IEEE.

AB Biometric systems can be attacked in several ways and the most common being spoofing the input sensor. Therefore, anti-spoofing is one of the most essential prerequisite against attacks on biometric systems. For face recognition it is even more vulnerable as the image capture is non-contact based. Several anti-spoofing methods have been proposed in the literature for both contact and non-contact based biometric modalities often using video to study the temporal characteristics of a real vs. spoofed biometric signal. This paper presents a novel multi-feature evidence aggregation method for face spoofing detection. The proposed method fuses evidence from features encoding of both texture and motion (liveness) properties in the face and also the surrounding scene regions. The feature extraction algorithms are based on a configuration of local binary pattern and motion estimation using histogram of oriented optical flow. Furthermore, the multi-feature windowed videolet aggregation of these orthogonal features coupled with support vector machine-based classification provides robustness to different attacks. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach by evaluating on three standard public databases: CASIA-FASD, 3DMAD and MSU-MFSD with equal error rate of 3.14%, 0%, and 0%, respectively. © 2016 IEEE.

AB As Face Recognition(FR) technology becomes more mature and commercially available in the market, many different anti-spoofing techniques have been recently developed to enhance the security, reliability, and effectiveness of FR systems. As a part of anti-spoofing techniques, face liveness detection plays an important role to make FR systems be more secured from various attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel method for face liveness detection by using focus, which is one of camera functions. In order to identify fake faces (e.g. 2D pictures), our approach utilizes the variation of pixel values by focusing between two images sequentially taken in different focuses. The experimental result shows that our focus-based approach is a new method that can significantly increase the level of difficulty of spoof attacks, which is a way to improve the security of FR systems. The performance is evaluated and the proposed method achieves 100% fake detection in a given DoF(Depth of Field). © 2013 IEEE.

AB It is a common spoof to use a photograph to fool face recognition algorithm. In light of differences in optical flow fields generated by movements of two-dimensional planes and three-dimensional objects, we proposed a new liveness detection method for face recognition. Under the assumption that the test region is a two-dimensional plane, we can obtain a reference field from the actual optical flow field data. Then the degree of differences between the two fields can be used to distinguish between a three-dimensional face and a two-dimensional photograph. Empirical study shows that the proposed approach is both feasible and effective. ©2009 IEEE.

AB A light field camera is a sensor that can record the directions as well as the colors of incident rays. This camera is widely utilized from 3D reconstruction to face and iris recognition. In this paper, we suggest a novel approach for defending spoofing face attacks, like printed 2D facial photos (hereinafter 2D photos) and HD tablet images, using the light field camera. By viewing the raw light field photograph from a different standpoint, we extract two special features which cannot be obtained from the conventional camera. To verify the performance, we compose light field photograph databases an conduct experiments. Our proposed method achieves at least 94.78% accuracy or up to 99.36% accuracy under different types of spoofing attacks. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB Objectives: To assess public knowledge of stroke and transient ischaemic attack symptoms, and awareness of the content of a recent national health campaign. Design: Interviewer-administered questionnaire. Setting: Leicester, UK. Participants: 1300 members of a mixed urban/rural, multiethnic population that was sampled in public areas, places of work and schools. Main outcome measures: Knowledge of the terms 'stroke', 'stroke risk factors' and the 'FAST campaign'. Awareness of stroke symptoms, and ability to distinguish from non-stroke symptoms. Results: 70% of the public surveyed were aware of the FAST campaign, with highest penetration in the female, older and white population. Overall, high levels of awareness of FAST symptoms (facial weakness 89%, arm weakness 83%, speech problems 91%) as warning signs of stroke were observed, though significantly lower levels were reported in the black and minority ethnic population. However, poor recognition of other important signs, including leg weakness (57%) and visual loss (44%) were seen, and significantly more men were likely to report non-specific symptoms as being associated with stroke. Conclusions: The survey has confirmed the effectiveness of the recent FAST campaign in raising public awareness of stroke and stroke warning signs, though poorest penetration was seen in the black and minority ethnic population. However, important stroke symptoms, including leg weakness and visual loss, were poorly recognised. This may lead to delays in presentation, specialist assessment and secondary prevention, and such stroke warning signs should be included in future public health campaigns.

AB We present a series of seven migraine patients with typical features of a migraine attack without aura, but atypical pain localization in the face in one or both of the lower two distributions of the trigeminal nerve (V2 and V3). All of them responded well to triptans. Three patients responded to preventive treatment for migraine with β-blockers (n = 2) or valproic acid (n = 1). These cases underline the heterogenic clinical presentation of migraine, which is sometimes difficult to diagnose even for headache specialists, and broaden the pathophysiological understanding of trigeminal nociceptive processing in migraine in the light of neuronal plasticity. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd Cephalalgia, 2007.

AB In recent years, software-based face presentation attack detection (PAD) methods have seen a great progress. However, most existing schemes are not able to generalize well in more realistic conditions. The objective of this competition is to evaluate and compare the generalization performances of mobile face PAD techniques under some real-world variations, including unseen input sensors, presentation attack instruments (PAI) and illumination conditions, on a larger scale OULU-NPU dataset using its standard evaluation protocols and metrics. Thirteen teams from academic and industrial institutions across the world participated in this competition. This time typical liveness detection based on physiological signs of life was totally discarded. Instead, every submitted system relies practically on some sort of feature representation extracted from the face and/or background regions using hand-crafted, learned or hybrid descriptors. Interesting results and findings are presented and discussed in this paper. © 2017 IEEE.

AB Turnover is commonplace in many online groups because of low barriers of entry and exit. In offline settings, turnover can have a negative impact because of reduced attachment to the group as an entity. However, in an online setting, turnover in terms of changes in the visible membership of a group may have a very different impact. Online only a limited amount of information about members and their activities is observable; in particular, it is easier to see the behavior of the subset of members who are active than the potentially larger set who are not. In this paper, we describe an experiment examining the influence of visible membership turnover on commitment to an online group. Our results suggest that increased turnover in an online group may increase social presence, creating perceptions of liveness, in turn leading to increased levels of participation in the group. However, this result holds primarily for groups with a common identity, suggesting that attention to behavior of others may be stronger when people share an identity with those others. Our results extend understandings of attachment in an online setting as well as theory about social tuning. © 2012 ACM.

AB RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) systems are emerging as one of the most pervasive computing technologies in history due to their low cost and their broad applicability. Although RFID networks have many advantages, they also present a number of inherent vulnerabilities with serious potential security implications. This paper develops a structural methodology for risks that RFID networks face by developing a classification of RFID attacks, presenting their important features, and discussing possible countermeasures. The goal of the paper is to categorize the existing weaknesses of RFID systems so that a better understanding of RFID attacks can be achieved and subsequently more efficient and effective algorithms, techniques and procedures to combat these attacks may be developed.

AB In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to bypass modern face authentication systems. More specifically, by leveraging a handful of pictures of the target user taken from social media, we show how to create realistic, textured, 3D facial models that undermine the security of widely used face authentication solutions. Our framework makes use of virtual reality (VR) systems, incorporating along the way the ability to perform animations (e.g., raising an eyebrow or smiling) of the facial model, in order to trick liveness detectors into believing that the 3D model is a real human face. The synthetic face of the user is displayed on the screen of the VR device, and as the device rotates and translates in the real world, the 3D face moves accordingly. To an observing face authentication system, the depth and motion cues of the display match what would be expected for a human face. We argue that such VR-based spoofing attacks constitute a fundamentally new class of attacks that point to a serious weaknesses in camera-based authentication systems: Unless they incorporate other sources of verifiable data, systems relying on color image data and camera motion are prone to attacks via virtual realism. To demonstrate the practical nature of this threat, we conduct thorough experiments using an end-to-end implementation of our approach and show how it undermines the security of several face authentication solutions that include both motion-based and liveness detectors. © 2016 Proceedings of the 25th USENIX Security Symposium.

AB Unilateral head pain focused on frontal, orbital or parietal regions is a leading symptom of migraine attacks. Rarely, head pain in migraine can extend involving the maxillary or mandibular region of the face, sometimes isolated facial pain is the only and atypical presentation of migraine. The prevalence of these unusual symptoms in migraine is unknown. We aimed to estimate the true prevalence of facial pain in migraine in a population-based sample of 517 migraine patients in Germany. In 46 (8.9%) cases migraine pain involved the head and the lower half of the face. Patients with facial pain suffer more trigemino-autonomic symptoms than migraine patients (47.8% vs. 7.9%; α2 = 66.23, P &lt; 0.001). In one case isolated facial pain without headache was the leading symptom of migraine. Our results demonstrate that facial pain is not unusual in migraine, whereas isolated facial migraine is extremely rare. © International Headache Society 2009.

AB Anti-spoofing is attracting growing interest in biometrics, considering the variety of fake materials and new means to attack biometric recognition systems. New unseen materials continuously challenge state-of-the-art spoofing detectors, suggesting for additional systematic approaches to target anti-spoofing. By incorporating liveness scores into the biometric fusion process, recognition accuracy can be enhanced, but traditional sum-rule based fusion algorithms are known to be highly sensitive to single spoofed instances. This paper investigates 1-median filtering as a spoofing-resistant generalised alternative to the sum-rule targeting the problem of partial multibiometric spoofing where m out of n biometric sources to be combined are attacked. Augmenting previous work, this paper investigates the dynamic detection and rejection of liveness-recognition pair outliers for spoofed samples in true multi-modal configuration with its inherent challenge of normalisation. As a further contribution, bootstrap aggregating (bagging) classifiers for fingerprint spoof-detection algorithm is presented. Experiments on the latest face video databases (Idiap Replay-Attack Database and CASIA Face Anti-Spoofing Database) and fingerprint spoofing database (Fingerprint Liveness Detection Competition 2013) illustrate the efficiency of proposed techniques. © 2015 The Authors.

AB With biometrics playing the role of a password which cannot be replaced if stolen, the necessity of establishing counter-measures to biometric spoofing attacks has been recognized. Regardless of the biometric mode, the typical approach of antispoofing systems is to classify the biometric evidence based on features discriminating between real accesses and spoofing attacks. For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, this paper studies the amount of client-specific information within these features and how it affects the performance of antispoofing systems. We make use of this information to build two client-specific antispoofing solutions, one relying on a generative and another one on a discriminative paradigm. The proposed methods, tested on a set of state-of-the-art antispoofing features for the face mode, outperform the client-independent approaches with up to 50% relative improvement and exhibit better generalization capabilities on unseen types of spoofing attacks. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB The vulnerability of biometric devices to spoof attacks and various anti-spoofing measures are discussed. Spoof attacks involve the use of an artificial biometric sample to gain unauthorized control. Various anti-spoofing measures have been developed to counteract this problem of spoofing. These anti-spoofing techniques include addition of supervision, password, smart cards, enrolment of several biometric samples, multi-modal biometrics, and liveness testing.

AB We revisit synthesis of live controllers for event-based operational models. We remove one aspect of an idealised problem domain by allowing to integrate failures of controller actions in the environment model. Classical treatment of failures through strong fairness leads to a very high computational complexity and may be insufficient for many interesting cases. We identify a realistic stronger fairness condition on the behaviour of failures. We show how to construct controllers satisfying liveness specifications under these fairness conditions. The resulting controllers exhibit the only possible behaviour in face of the given topology of failures: they keep retrying and never give up. We then identify some well-structure conditions on the environment. These conditions ensure that the resulting controller will be eager to satisfy its goals. Furthermore, for environments that satisfy these conditions and have an underlying probabilistic behaviour, the measure of traces that satisfy our fairness condition is 1, giving a characterisation of the kind of domains in which the approach is applicable. © 2011 ACM.

AB The importance of personal authentication is increasing with the development of the information society. The accuracy of personal authentication by identifying the iris is higher than that by using other biometric traits such as faces or fingerprints. However, the iris authentication system is vulnerable to deception by a fake iris even though the recognition accuracy is high. In this study, we developed a liveness detection method by using a variation in the brightness of an iris pattern induced by a pupillary reflex. The live and artificial irises were classified by a decision threshold of 7% brightness variation rate. © 2007 SICE.

AB For face authentication to become widespread on mobile devices, robust countermeasures must be developed for face presentation-attack detection (PAD). Existing databases for evaluating face-PAD methods do not capture the specific characteristics of mobile devices. We introduce a new database, REPLAY-MOBILE, for this purpose.1 This publicly available database includes 1,200 videos corresponding to 40 clients. Besides the genuine videos, the database contains a variety of presentation-attacks. The database also provides three nonoverlapping sets for training, validating and testing classifiers for the face-PAD problem. This will help researchers in comparing new approaches to existing algorithms in a standardized fashion. For this purpose, we also provide baseline results with stateof-the-art approaches based on image quality analysis and face texture analysis2. © 2016 Gesellschaft für Informatik e.V., Bonn, Germany.

AB Background and objective. Dog bites are a major cause of preventable traumatic injury in the paediatric population. We aimed to determine the epidemiology of dog bite injuries in a group of South African children with a view to developing potential preventive strategies. Design, setting, subjects. A retrospective review was done of patients presenting with dog bite injuries to the trauma unit at the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital in Cape Town over a 13.5-year period. Results. We identified 1 871 children treated for 2 021 dog bite injuries during the study period. Dog bites accounted for 1.5% of all trauma unit presentations. Male children accounted for 68% of the patients. Children under 6 years of age were more likely to have sustained injuries to the head, face or neck, while children older than 6 years more commonly received injuries to the perineum, buttocks, legs or feet. Younger children were more likely to be attacked at home and older children outside the home. The most frequent injuries were superficial, and the majority of patients were treated with simple medication, dressing or suturing. There were no dog bite-related fatalities. Conclusion. The relationship between the geographical location of dog attacks on children and the age groups attacked suggests that strategies to prevent dog bites should target both parents supervising younger children at home, and older children who encounter dogs outside the home.

AB Fingerprint-based authentication systems have developed rapidly in the recent years. However, current fingerprint-based biometric systems are vulnerable to spoofing attacks. Moreover, single feature-based static approach does not perform equally over different fingerprint sensors and spoofing materials. In this paper, we propose a static software approach. We propose to combine low-level gradient features from speeded-up robust features, pyramid extension of the histograms of oriented gradient and texture features from Gabor wavelet using dynamic score level integration. We extract these features from a single fingerprint image to overcome the issues faced in dynamic software approaches, which require user cooperation and longer computational time. A experimental analysis done on LivDet 2011 data produced an average equal error rate (EER) of 3.95% over four databases. The result outperforms the existing best average EER of 9.625%. We also performed experiments with LivDet 2013 database and achieved an average classification error rate of 2.27% in comparison with 12.87% obtained by the LivDet 2013 competition winner. © 2016 IEEE.

AB Face recognition based on 2D images is a widely used biometric approach. This is mainly due to the simplicity and high usability of this approach. Nonetheless, those solutions are vulnerable to spoof attacks made by non-real faces. In order to identify malicious attacks on such biometric systems, 2D face liveness detection approaches are developed. In this work, face liveness detection approaches are categorized based on the type of liveness indicator used. This categorization helps understanding different spoof attacks scenarios and their relation to the developed solutions. A review of the latest works dealing with face liveness detection works is presented. A discussion is made to link the state of the art solutions with the presented categorization along with the available and possible future datasets. All that aim to provide a clear path for the future development of innovative face liveness detection solutions. © 2012 Gesellschaft fr Informatik.

AB Background: Stroke recognition tools have been shown to improve diagnostic accuracy in adults. Development of a similar tool in children is needed to reduce lag time to diagnosis. A critical first step is to determine whether adult stoke scales can be applied in childhood stroke.Our objective was to assess the applicability of adult stroke scales in childhood arterial ischemic stroke (AIS). Methods: Children aged 1 month to < 18 years with radiologically confirmed acute AIS who presented to a tertiary emergency department (ED) (2003 to 2008) were identified retrospectively. Signs, symptoms, risk factors and initial management were extracted. Two adult stroke recognition tools; ROSIER (Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room) and FAST (Face Arm Speech Test) scales were applied retrospectively to all patients to determine test sensitivity.Results: 47 children with AIS were identified. 34 had anterior, 12 had posterior and 1 child had anterior and posterior circulation infarcts. Median age was 9 years and 51% were male. Median time from symptom onset to ED presentation was 21 hours but one third of children presented within 6 hours. The most common presenting stroke symptoms were arm (63%), face (62%), leg weakness (57%), speech disturbance (46%) and headache (46%). The most common signs were arm (61%), face (70%) or leg weakness (57%) and dysarthria (34%). 36 (78%) of children had at least one positive variable on FAST and 38 (81%) had a positive score of ≥1 on the ROSIER scale. Positive scores were less likely in children with posterior circulation stroke.Conclusion: The presenting features of pediatric stroke appear similar to adult strokes. Two adult stroke recognition tools have fair to good sensitivity in radiologically confirmed childhood AIS but require further development and modification. Specificity of the tools also needs to be determined in a prospective cohort of children with stroke and non-stroke brain attacks. © 2011 Yock-Corrales et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB Medical biometrics offer direct solutions to the liveness and impersonation detection risks which dominate traditional biometric modalities, like the iris, the face or the fingerprint. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a cardiac signal which falls under this category, and which has lately drawn interest from the biometrics community. This paper presents a novel recognition method based on ECG signals, which enhances the AC/LDA feature extraction algorithm, by incorporating the periodicity transform (PT). It is demonstrated that PT is a powerful tool not only in assessing the matching validity of the signal, but also in handling heart rate changes. The performance of the system over 52 subjects is 92.3%. ©2010 IEEE.

AB Face anti-spoofing (a.k.a. presentation attack detection) has recently emerged as an active topic with great significance for both academia and industry due to the rapidly increasing demand in user authentication on mobile phones, PCs, tablets, and so on. Recently, numerous face spoofing detection schemes have been proposed based on the assumption that training and testing samples are in the same domain in terms of the feature space and marginal probability distribution. However, due to unlimited variations of the dominant conditions (illumination, facial appearance, camera quality, and so on) in face acquisition, such single domain methods lack generalization capability, which further prevents them from being applied in practical applications. In light of this, we introduce an unsupervised domain adaptation face anti-spoofing scheme to address the real-world scenario that learns the classifier for the target domain based on training samples in a different source domain. In particular, an embedding function is first imposed based on source and target domain data, which maps the data to a new space where the distribution similarity can be measured. Subsequently, the Maximum Mean Discrepancy between the latent features in source and target domains is minimized such that a more generalized classifier can be learned. State-of-the-art representations including both hand-crafted and deep neural network learned features are further adopted into the framework to quest the capability of them in domain adaptation. Moreover, we introduce a new database for face spoofing detection, which contains more than 4000 face samples with a large variety of spoofing types, capture devices, illuminations, and so on. Extensive experiments on existing benchmark databases and the new database verify that the proposed approach can gain significantly better generalization capability in cross-domain scenarios by providing consistently better anti-spoofing performance. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB The purpose of the present study was to analyse the variability in clubhead presentation to the ball and the resulting ball impact location on the club face for a range of golfers of different ability. A total of 285 male and female participants hit multiple shots using one of four proprietary drivers. Self-reported handicap was used to quantify a participant's golfing ability. A bespoke motion capture system and user-written algorithms were used to track the clubhead just before and at impact, measuring clubhead speed, clubhead orientation, and impact location. A Doppler radar was used to measure golf ball speed. Generally, golfers of higher skill (lower handicap) generated increased clubhead speed and increased efficiency (ratio of ball speed to clubhead speed). Non-parametric statistical tests showed that low-handicap golfers exhibit significantly lower variability from shot to shot in clubhead speed, efficiency, impact location, attack angle, club path, and face angle compared with high-handicap golfers. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.
